</p>

<p>
This is the story of the Hailey Compton Village
Pageant.
</p>

<p>
Pageants, good and bad, great and small,
were commonplace affairs a few years ago.
Every summer half a dozen of them were
widely advertised and probably a dozen more
ran blameless courses unnoticed except by
those who took part in them. They were
started by enthusiasts, worked up by energetic
committees, kept within the bounds of historic
possibility by scholarly experts. They came
and went, amused a few people, bored a great
many and left not a trace of their brief existence
behind them.
</p>

<p>
The Hailey Compton Pageant was staged in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_6' name='Page_6'>[6]</a></span>
a small unimportant village. The people
who organised it, the vicar's wife and the
local innkeeper, were unknown to fame.
It had, at first, no backing in the press
except a few paragraphs slipped into provincial
papers by Miss Beth Appleby, a
young journalist of promise but small attainment.
It had, at first, no aristocratic patronage,
except the half-hearted support of Sir
Evelyn Dent. It began in a casual, almost
accidental way.
</p>

<p>
Yet the Hailey Compton Pageant excited
England from end to end, set every club in
London gossiping, inspired a spate of articles
in the daily papers, smirched the reputation of
an earl and went near wrecking, at the next
General Election, the prospects of a prominent
statesman.
</p>

<p>
Such are the tricks which destiny, a sportive
imp, plays with human affairs. An elderly
gentleman, in search of local colour for a perfectly
innocent book, visits a remote village.
An energetic lady with a taste for theatricals
seizes an opportunity for getting up a show.
An innkeeper, civil to every one and anxious
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_7' name='Page_7'>[7]</a></span>
to be obliging to all possible patrons, sees a
chance of making a little money.
</p>

<p>
What could possibly be less important? Yet
out of the activities of these people rose one of
the most widely discussed scandals of our time.

</p>

<h2>Chapter I</h2>

<p>
It has been said, somewhat bitterly, that the
whole south coast of England is now one prolonged
watering-place, very horrible because
very popular. The bitterness is excusable, but
the saying is an exaggeration. There are still
some places unvisited by chars-à-bancs and
excursionists, undiscovered, or at all events
unused by those who "take the kiddies to the
sea" for August.
</p>

<p>
Hailey Compton is a village which until the
other day escaped the curse of popularity. Its
good fortune was due partly to the fact that
there are no houses or lodgings in it suitable for
letting. Nor can any be built for there is no
room for building. The village lies in a narrow
nook between high cliffs and all the ground is
already occupied by fishermen's cottages, with
their patches of garden, the church, the vicarage,
and the Anchor Inn. It is also&mdash;and this
helps to account for its escape from the general
fate&mdash;very difficult of access. The only
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_10' name='Page_10'>[10]</a></span>
approach to it is by a steep, sharply twisting
lane, with a surface of abominable roughness.
Horses descend with extreme difficulty and
climb up again only if they are very strong.
Motorists shrink from the hairpin bends and
the blinding high banks between which the
lane zigzags. Even chars-à-bancs drivers, the
gallant swashbucklers of our modern traffic,
never venture to take their clients to Hailey
Compton.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless a car crept down the hill one
warm, May morning, a light car, driven by an
elderly man who sat alone in it. He went very
cautiously, his engine responding to its lowest
gear, his foot pressed on the brake pedal, his
hands clutching the steering wheel convulsively.
This was Sir Evelyn Dent, and the car was a
new possession which he had only just learned
to drive, indeed had not yet learned to drive
without nervousness. The age of sixty-five
is rather late in life for acquiring so difficult
an art as motor driving.
</p>

<p>
Sir Evelyn bought this car after the fall of
the Government, when he ceased to be a
Cabinet Minister. He might not have bought
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_11' name='Page_11'>[11]</a></span>
it even then, if he had not lost his seat in Parliament
in the disastrous General Election which
followed the resignation of the Prime Minister.
While still in office, with a salary of some
thousands a year to cover expenses, Sir Evelyn
owned a large car and was driven about by a
competent chauffeur. Having lost his salary
and having no longer any official expenses he
economised by buying a small car and driving
it himself. The plan had certain advantages.
He could go driving where he pleased and when.
Previously he had gone where the chauffeur, a
very superior man, thought a Cabinet Minister
ought to go at hours which he regarded as
suitable.
</p>

<p>
The lane twisted on, the gradient becoming
steeper and the surface worse. Sir Evelyn
ventured from time to time to raise his strained
eyes from the road immediately in front of him
and glance at the roofs of the houses which
lay below, and the sea, blue and sparkling, below
them. Each time he looked the roofs and the
sea seemed a little nearer, which cheered him;
but the descent still twisted before him. He
began to wonder whether his nerves would
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_12' name='Page_12'>[12]</a></span>
remain under control until he reached the
bottom. Sweat broke out on his forehead and
trickled into his eyes, cold sweat. His hands
on the wheel were moist and cold. On the
other hand&mdash;such are the compensations which
nature arranges&mdash;the inside of his mouth became
perfectly dry, so that it was painful to
swallow. Yet he had to swallow each time he
crawled round one of the blind corners and
found nothing on the other side.
</p>

<p>
There was much excuse for Sir Evelyn's
nervousness. A highly skilled driver would
have disliked the hill. Sir Evelyn was a novice.
A reckless youth would have hesitated over it.
Sir Evelyn was sixty-five and most unwilling
to throw away the few years of life remaining
to him. It is greatly to his credit and a proof
of the fine qualities which had raised him to
the position of Cabinet Minister that he reached
the bottom of the hill safely. Passing a row
of fishermen's cottages, he crawled, not daring
to change gear, till he came to the Anchor Inn.
There he stopped. A board, either new or
newly painted, announced that James Hinton
was licensed to sell beer, spirits and tobacco.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_13' name='Page_13'>[13]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Sir Evelyn passed the tip of a dry tongue
across a dry lip. At the moment it seemed to
him that beer, even the poorest, thinnest beer, any
beer at all, was the best thing the world contained.
He left his car and went into the tap-room.
</p>

<p>
Had Sir Evelyn been capable for the moment
of any feeling except a desire for beer he would
have been surprised at the tap-room of the
Anchor Inn in Hailey Compton. Instead of
reeking stuffily of stale beer, the place was
fresh, cool and pleasant. Instead of a soiled
floor, were clean polished boards. Instead of a
messy counter and stained tables there was
shining cleanliness. Not such are English inns
in remote villages. Though thirsty Sir Evelyn
could not help noticing the landlord when he
came in. He was not in the least the landlord
who might have been expected in such a village.
He came from an inner room and greeted Sir
Evelyn with respectful courtesy. He was a
tall, slim man, neatly dressed, cleanly shaved.
He might still have been, what indeed he once
was, the valet of a wealthy peer.
</p>

<p>
"A glass of beer," said Sir Evelyn. "In
fact a jug of beer."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_14' name='Page_14'>[14]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The landlord, the James Hinton of the newly
painted board, spread out apologetic hands.
</p>

<p>
"Very sorry sir," he said. "Very sorry
indeed, sir; but at this hour&mdash;&mdash; The law, sir.
The law. Most unfortunate, but you know
how it is, sir."
</p>

<p>
Sir Evelyn did know and groaned. He had
descended the hill at an unfortunate time,
arriving at the Anchor Inn at one of those hours
during which, no doubt to the advantage of
the souls of Englishmen, the buying of a glass
of beer is a breach of the law.
</p>

<p>
Sir Evelyn's guardian angel, watching from
on high, smiled, and no one can blame him.
He would have been less and not greater than a
mortal if he had not been a little amused.
Here was a man who had spent his life in making
laws; who had taken a pleasure in that most
objectionable occupation; who had given
energy and considerable ability to the discovery
of new laws, if possible sillier and more vexatious
than those already made. Here was this man,
parched with thirst, a-quiver with jangled
nerves, cut off from the only thing in the world
which would do him any good, by one of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_15' name='Page_15'>[15]</a></span>
very laws which he and his fellows had made.
It is true that Sir Evelyn had never been
directly and personally concerned with the laws
which regulate the sale of beer, but he had been
responsible for others quite as idiotic.
</p>

<p>
And once&mdash;the guardian angel sniggered
when he remembered this&mdash;Sir Evelyn answering
a tiresome questioner in Parliament, had
said that he saw no reason why any of the
existing laws should be repealed.
</p>

<p>
Here, surely, was an instance of that poetic
justice, far too rare in the world, in which all
good men rejoice and which angels, guardian
and others, can scarce forbear to cheer.
</p>

<p>
But justice in this world is seldom perfect
and even angels sometimes smile too soon.
It appeared that James Hinton was no fanatical
worshipper of the letter of the law.
</p>

<p>
"If I might venture to make a suggestion,
Sir Evelyn&mdash;&mdash;" he said and paused.
</p>

<p>
Sir Evelyn was surprised by the use of his
name and title. He had never been in Hailey
Compton before and this prompt recognition
was unexpected. A man may be an ex-Cabinet
Minister, may be adorned with a knighthood,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_16' name='Page_16'>[16]</a></span>
may be, as Sir Evelyn was, the son of one earl,
brother of another and uncle of a third, may
be entitled to be styled the Honourable, besides
being a knight; but he does not go about the
world with a placard round his neck announcing
these glories. He looked sharply at the innkeeper.
</p>

<p>
James Hinton offered an apologetic explanation
of his knowledge.
</p>

<p>
"I sometimes had the pleasure of waiting
on you, sir, when I was first footman in the
service of your brother, the late earl."
</p>

<p>
"What about the beer?" said Sir Evelyn.
</p>

<p>
He began to feel hopeful. A retired servant
is a family friend and ought to have more
respect for the memory of a dead master than
he has for an existing law.
</p>

<p>
"If I might venture to suggest, sir&mdash;&mdash;"
said Hinton again.
</p>

<p>
"You may suggest anything," said Sir
Evelyn, "except lemonade. That, I cannot
stand."
</p>

<p>
"Nothing would induce me to offer you such
a thing, sir. If you'll excuse my mentioning a
personal matter, sir, I have lived in good houses,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_17' name='Page_17'>[17]</a></span>
some of the best in England, before coming
here, and I'm aware that lemonade&mdash;with the
possible exception of the home-brewed variety
when suffering from influenza&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"If it's not lemonade," said Sir Evelyn,
"what is it?"
</p>

<p>
"My suggestion, sir&mdash;and I hope you will
not regard it as unduly familiar from one in
my position in life&mdash;is that you should be my
guest, my private guest, for perhaps ten minutes
or a quarter of an hour, and during that time
share a jug of beer with me in my little room,
my own snuggery, behind the bar. There is,
of course, no question of payment. Therefore
there is no breach of the law."
</p>

<p>
"But I should like to pay for what I drink,"
said Sir Evelyn.
</p>

<p>
He was as thirsty as a man can be, but he
shrank from drinking at the expense of a footman.
</p>

<p>
James Hinton's eyes were fixed on a large
photograph of one of England's stately homes
which hung, nicely framed, on the wall of the
tap-room. He spoke in a tone of reminiscence,
as a man does who tells a tale of old times, a tale
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_18' name='Page_18'>[18]</a></span>
which has nothing whatever to do with the life
of to-day.
</p>

<p>
"In the houses in which I used to live, sir, it
was customary for guests to offer some slight
token of esteem, what is commonly spoken of
as a tip, to the servants when departing. There
was of course no obligation to give anything.
The tip was entirely voluntary, a gift, sir, not
a payment, if you catch my meaning."
</p>

<p>
Sir Evelyn caught it; he was to have his glass
of beer in spite of the law, but it was to cost him
two and sixpence, at least two and sixpence,
perhaps five shillings. In the best houses it
is scarcely possible to offer less than five shillings
to the first footman.
</p>

<p>
"Hailey Compton is a very quiet place,"
said James Hinton a few minutes later when
he had filled Sir Evelyn's glass. "I don't
know that I ever came across a quieter place.
No society, unless you count the vicar and his
lady. A very nice gentleman, the vicar, though
not very energetic. But perhaps you know
our vicar, the Rev. Mr. Eames?"
</p>

<p>
Sir Evelyn did not and said so, holding out
his glass for more beer. If he had to pay five
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_19' name='Page_19'>[19]</a></span>
shillings for his drink he felt entitled to quench
his thirst.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps you know Mrs. Eames, sir," said
Hinton, pouring out the beer. "A remarkable
lady, Mrs. Eames, if I may say so without
disrespect. A very remarkable lady, though
a little trying at times to the vicar."
</p>

<p>
Sir Evelyn took no more interest in Mrs.
Eames than he did in the vicar. He was not a
rural dean, nor an archdeacon, and his visit to
Hailey Compton had nothing to do with the
church.
</p>

<p>
"But of course not, sir," said Hinton. "It's
not to be expected that you would know Mrs.
Eames or the vicar."
</p>

<p>
Then he waited, hoping to hear what had
brought Sir Evelyn to Hailey Compton. He
was not disappointed.
</p>

<p>
"I understand," said Sir Evelyn, "that there
is a remarkable sea cave in this neighbourhood."
</p>

<p>
James Hinton talked fluently and agreeably
about the cave. He described its position and
how to get to it. He congratulated Sir Evelyn
on having arrived in Hailey Compton at a
fortunate hour.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_20' name='Page_20'>[20]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Not altogether fortunate, sir, as regards
the beer. But if you wish to visit the cave
you could hardly have come at a better time."
</p>

<p>
The cave, it appeared, was accessible on foot
only between half-tide and low water. At other
times it must be approached by boat, and
landing, except in calm weather, was difficult.
</p>

<p>
"According to local tradition, sir, the cave
was at one time largely used by smugglers.
But no doubt you know more about that than
I do."
</p>

<p>
Sir Evelyn did. He knew more about the
Hailey Compton cave, indeed more about all
smugglers' caves on our coasts, than any man
in England.
</p>

<p>
Having been forced, by a turn of the political
wheel to leave office, he had retired to a pleasant
old Manor House, once the property of his aunt,
Lady Mildred Dent. It stood surrounded by
gardens, some twenty miles from Hailey Compton.
It had the advantage of being in the
middle of the constituency which had lately
rejected Sir Evelyn, which might, he hoped
would, ultimately change its mind. There
he settled down contentedly enough with his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_21' name='Page_21'>[21]</a></span>
pictures, his old prints, his books and manuscripts,
until such time as he could appeal to
the voters again.
</p>

<p>
Sir Evelyn had spent his adult life in making
laws and arranging for their administration.
It was perhaps not unnatural that he should
have cherished a secret love and admiration
for law breakers. If a bishop were to tell the
naked truth about himself he would probably
say that what he looked forward to most in
heaven was the chance of intimacy with heretics.
A doctor, in hours of relaxation and influenced
by good wine, will confess to a liking for quacks
and a contempt for orthodox methods of cure.
</p>

<p>
Sir Evelyn's affections went out to the
smugglers of the eighteenth and early nineteenth
centuries, bold defiers of law every one of them.
He had gathered a small library about smugglers
and made a collection of pictures and prints
illustrating their ways. It was his intention
to devote his years, or months, of leisure&mdash;the
period during which the life of Parliament was
denied him&mdash;to the production of a complete
illustrated history of English smuggling. The
thing has never been done, and Sir Evelyn felt
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_22' name='Page_22'>[22]</a></span>
it was due to the memory of a number of
adventurous men that it should be done sympathetically.
</p>

<p>
He intended, in course of time, to visit and
photograph all the genuine smugglers' caves
there were. He had already made a list of
them, carefully eliminating those whose connection
with smugglers was uncertain. It was
chiefly with a view to visiting the caves that
he had bought and more or less learned to
drive his motor. His plan was to spend the
summer, perhaps several summers, in investigating
the caves one by one. During the winter
he meant to arrange the material collected,
make extracts from books, and in due time
actually write the great history.
</p>

<p>
The Hailey Compton cave, an unquestionably
genuine haunt of eighteenth century
smugglers, was first on his list. He reached it&mdash;as
has been already noted&mdash;early in May
after a drive of some peril.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps, sir," said Hinton, "you may be
returning here for luncheon after your visit to
the cave. I can scarcely recommend it though
I shall do my best. This is a poor house, sir,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_23' name='Page_23'>[23]</a></span>
not at all what you're accustomed to. I can
scarcely venture to promise more than a slice
of cold beef, a cut off the Sunday joint, with
some bread and cheese. The cheese, if I may
say so, is excellent. But perhaps you will
prefer to lunch at the vicarage. Mrs. Eames
is a very hospitable lady, sir, and I may take
it upon myself to say that she will be delighted
to entertain you."
</p>

<p>
"I shall lunch here," said Sir Evelyn, "on
whatever you can give me."
</p>

<p>
"Very good, sir, I merely mentioned the
vicarage because I thought you might like to
meet Mrs. Eames. A very remarkable lady,
sir."
</p>

<p>
"I do not want to meet Mrs. Eames," said
Sir Evelyn. "And I shall not lunch at the
vicarage."
</p>

<p>
Here Sir Evelyn's guardian angel smiled
again. How far these beings arrange our
future for us is uncertain, but there is no
doubt that they know what is going to happen
to us some time ahead. When they hear us
asserting confidently that we are going to do
something, or not going to do it, they are
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_24' name='Page_24'>[24]</a></span>
amused, being aware that our plans have very
little to do with what actually happens. Sir
Evelyn's angel knew perfectly well that his
ward would lunch that day at the vicarage,
that he would meet Mrs. Eames, and that
consequences of the most unexpected kind
would follow. His smile died wholly away
when he reflected that it would be his business
to extricate Sir Evelyn from the tangled difficulties
in which he was soon to be involved,
which began with his visit to the Hailey
Compton Vicarage.
</p>

<h2>Chapter II</h2>

<p>
Sir Evelyn left the Anchor Inn, took his
camera from the car and set out on the way
which Hinton had described to him.
</p>

<p>
It was not a very pleasant way. It first
passed along the village street which smelt of
decaying fish and was strewed with empty
lobster pots, broken spars and disused oars.
Here he was stared at with unblinking hostility
by a number of men who leaned against the
walls of cottages with their hands in their
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_25' name='Page_25'>[25]</a></span>
pockets. He was surveyed apparently with
amused dislike by women who came to the
doors with babies in their arms. He would
have been giggled at by children if they had
not all been shut up at school at that hour.
</p>

<p>
Having reached the end of the street he
skirted a slimy and very smelly boat haven
beyond which he reached a space of coarse
grass. Here nets were spread out to dry and
long rows of geese paraded solemnly. Sir
Evelyn picked his way among the nets and
tried to be indifferent to the geese which
stretched out their necks and hissed at him.
Having crossed the grass he climbed the sea
wall and dropped down on a stony beach. It
was a disagreeable beach covered with round
white stones. Some of these were about the
size of potatoes. They rolled when Sir Evelyn
trod on them and he ran some risk of spraining
his ankles. Others were larger, about the size
of field turnips, and they were coated with
pale green weed. Sir Evelyn slipped when he
walked on one of them.
</p>

<p>
At the back, the shoreward end of the beach,
the cliffs rose abruptly to a plateau on which
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_26' name='Page_26'>[26]</a></span>
the church stood. A hundred yards or so from
the village green was the cave. Sir Evelyn,
stumbling doggedly on, reached it slightly out
of breath.
</p>

<p>
A surprise waited him. Under the huge
arch which formed the entrance of the cave
is a pool, ten or twelve feet deep, large
enough to hold a fair sized fishing smack. The
rocks at the side of the pool are as steep as if
they had been cut away to form a dock or a
swimming bath. The water is bright green
and so clear that the pebbles at the bottom
can be plainly seen.
</p>

<p>
Sir Evelyn unstrapped his camera, preparing
to photograph the entrance of the cave. He
saw to his annoyance that he was not alone.
A woman was standing at the far side of the
pool. She wore a bright red bathing dress and
a blue waterproof cap. At the moment when
Sir Evelyn caught sight of her she was poised
for a plunge into the green water.
</p>

<p>
An imaginative and slightly short-sighted
man might have fancied himself unexpectedly
blessed with a vision of a mermaid or some
other kind of water nymph. The great arch
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_27' name='Page_27'>[27]</a></span>
of the cave, the gloomy hollow beyond it, the
clear water and the shining rock, formed a
natural and proper haunt for a marine damsel.
But Sir Evelyn was not romantic. Men who
rise to eminence in politics are almost always
realists. And he was not short-sighted. He
could see perfectly well that the lady on the
rock had a sturdy figure and unusually thick
legs. All nymphs, woodland or marine, are
slim creatures and young. The lady on the
rock was not very young, but if he had had
any doubt about what she was her greeting
would have dispelled it.
</p>

<p>
"Hallo!" she shouted.
</p>

<p>
Sir Evelyn, who was a courteous gentleman,
took off his hat, bowed and apologised for his
intrusion.
</p>

<p>
"I'm exceedingly sorry for disturbing you,"
he said. "If I had known you were bathing
I should have waited until you had finished."
</p>

<p>
"Hold on a minute," said the lady. "I
can't hear a word you're saying."
</p>

<p>
She plunged, a neat header with scarcely a
splash. He saw the red clad form, curved
stiffly from neck to heel, shooting through the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_28' name='Page_28'>[28]</a></span>
clear water. The blue cap emerged, plump
arms flashed and splashed. With incredible
swiftness and all the grace of a swimming seal
she crossed the pool. Grasping the rock at
Sir Evelyn's feet she pulled herself half out
of the water and looked at him with a gleaming
smile.
</p>

<p>
"This is quite exciting," she said. "I don't
think I ever saw anyone here before. Do tell
me who you are and what you're doing."
</p>

<p>
The approach and the questioning which
followed it surprised Sir Evelyn. This was not
the way in which strangers usually sought to
make his acquaintance. But though shocked
and a little startled, he was not angry. It is
almost impossible to be angry with a dripping,
smiling, friendly lady who emerges from the
water at your feet.
</p>

<p>
"My dear lady&mdash;&mdash;" he began, rather
pompously but quite kindly.
</p>

<p>
"My name," she said, "is Eames, Agatha
Eames, and my husband is vicar of the parish."
</p>

<p>
"Dear me!" said Sir Evelyn a little startled.
</p>

<p>
He had a fairly clear idea in his mind of what
the wives of our country clergy are like, an
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_29' name='Page_29'>[29]</a></span>
idea formed on the descriptions of these ladies
given by our novelists. They are elderly,
angular, severe, conventional in their outlook
on life and morals, inclined to bitter speaking
of a slanderous kind, clothed in body and
equipped in mind after the fashion of provincial
spinsters of fifty years ago. The lady who
looked up at him in no way corresponded to
his mental picture of what a country vicar's
wife ought to be.
</p>

<p>
"My name," he said, "is Dent, Evelyn
Dent."
</p>

<p>
"Evelyn Dent! But, of course, Sir Evelyn
Dent. <i>The</i> Sir Evelyn Dent."
</p>

<p>
This prompt recognition of his eminence
surprised Sir Evelyn. In political circles he
was of course well known. Socially, as son,
brother and uncle of three succeeding earls,
he held a distinguished position. But he
scarcely expected to find himself known to a
plump lady bathing in a lonely pool. Recollecting
Hinton's earlier recognition in the Anchor
Inn, it occurred to him that this lady might at
one time have been cook in the house of his
father, brother or nephew. In the eighteenth
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_30' name='Page_30'>[30]</a></span>
century, according to Thackeray, the clergy
often married upper servants. For all Sir
Evelyn knew they might be doing so still.
</p>

<p>
With this idea in his mind he smiled in a
friendly way. Mrs. Eames, no doubt encouraged
by this sign of amiability, climbed out
of the pool, sat down on a rock at his feet and
began rubbing the water off her legs with
curved palms.
</p>

<p>
"So you know who I am," he said, expecting
a confession that she had in other days fried
bacon for his breakfast.
</p>

<p>
But Mrs. Eames had never been a cook and
knew Sir Evelyn only as a public man.
</p>

<p>
"Of course I know who you are," she said.
"I have often heard of your splendid work in
the Foreign Office&mdash;or if it wasn't the Foreign
Office, the Treasury."
</p>

<p>
Sir Evelyn's splendid work had not been
done either in the Foreign Office or the
Treasury.
</p>

<p>
"Not quite right," he said.
</p>

<p>
"A Cabinet Minister, anyhow," said Mrs.
Eames, "and frightfully important. Chairman
of no end of Royal Commissions."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_31' name='Page_31'>[31]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Only three," said Sir Evelyn, as if modestly
disclaiming a well deserved honour which had
not been bestowed on him.
</p>

<p>
"Three seems no end of a lot to me," said
Mrs. Eames. "In fact three is no end of a
lot when it's Royal Commissions. Of course
three cigarettes wouldn't be much or three
apples. Was anyone else ever Chairman of
three Royal Commissions?"
</p>

<p>
Sir Evelyn was not vainer or fonder of praise
than most elderly and successful men. Vanity
is supposed to be the besetting sin of young
women. It is really the devil's most successful
lure for old gentlemen, and Sir Evelyn had not
escaped it. Long after the other six deadly
sins have ceased to be dangerous, when the
blood is too sluggish for lust, when bitter
experience has taught the folly of gluttony,
when there is little left in life with the power
to move to anger, whenever avarice&mdash;though
Byron calls it an old-gentlemanly vice&mdash;is a
temptation of the past, then vanity attacks a
man whose life has given any excuse for it, and
he generally falls. With grey hairs and a
measure of success there comes to most of us,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_32' name='Page_32'>[32]</a></span>
as to Sir Evelyn, a strong sense of our own
importance.
</p>

<p>
"I wonder," he said modestly, "how you
come to be interested in my commonplace
career."
</p>

<p>
"You mustn't think," said Mrs. Eames,
"that because I live in Hailey Compton I'm
interested in nothing except the parish pump."
</p>

<p>
"No doubt," said Sir Evelyn, becoming
ponderously playful, "so omniscient a lady will
be able to guess what has brought me here
to-day."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Eames took off her bathing cap and ran
her fingers through her hair as if deeply pondering.
Her hair was red and had been cropped
by the village barber, a fisherman and only an
amateur at hair-cutting, who had heard of but
not actually seen the fashionable bobbing and
shingling. The result was comfortable but not
becoming. The absence of floating locks made
Mrs. Eames's face look bigger than it was and
her features did not bear exaggeration well.
They gave the impression of having been rather
hurriedly put into their places&mdash;eyes, nose,
mouth and chin&mdash;by a modeller who had learnt
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_33' name='Page_33'>[33]</a></span>
his art through a correspondence class. The
general effect was lumpy and, on closer looking,
rather crooked.
</p>

<p>
"A little bird whispered to me&mdash;&mdash;" she
said.
</p>

<p>
"A little what?"
</p>

<p>
"Bird. Of course it wasn't really a bird.
And even if it had been it wouldn't have
whispered. Birds don't. They twitter. I
ought to have said 'Lilith lisped to me&mdash;&mdash;'"
</p>

<p>
"Lilith!"
</p>

<p>
"Surely you know 'The Lispings of Lilith,'"
said Mrs. Eames.
</p>

<p>
Sir Evelyn had to confess that he did not.
</p>

<p>
"Lilith," said Mrs. Eames, "is my niece,
Beth Appleby. My name was Appleby before
I married poor dear Timothy. She does a
column called 'The Lispings of Lilith' which
comes out every week in about a dozen provincial
papers. Syndicated, you know. I
couldn't get on without it. It keeps me up to
all that's going on in the great world outside
Hailey Compton. Surely you've read it?"
</p>

<p>
"Never," said Sir Evelyn.
</p>

<p>
"You'd have liked last week's. There was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_34' name='Page_34'>[34]</a></span>
a Lisping about you. 'Lilith lisps,' that's how
every paragraph begins, 'that Sir Evelyn Dent,
who has recently retired from public life, is
devoting his leisure to a study of the history
of English smuggling on which he is expected
to produce a &mdash;&mdash;' Now what was it Beth
called it? Either a monograph or a <i>magnum
opus</i>."
</p>

<p>
Sir Evelyn was aware that some paragraphs,
based on hints which he had given himself, had
appeared here and there about his devotion to
historical research. No doubt "Lilith" or
Miss Appleby had copied one of them into the
column of provincial lispings.
</p>

<p>
"Very annoying," he said. "Very annoying
indeed. This craze for the publication of the
personal affairs of private individuals is one of
the crying evils of our time."
</p>

<p>
But Mrs. Eames, though talkative, was by
no means a fool. She knew that Sir Evelyn did
not find paragraphs in the papers about his
historical work in the least annoying. He
liked them. He would have liked them even
if they had dealt with his favourite shaving
soap. All eminent men like this kind of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_35' name='Page_35'>[35]</a></span>
publicity. If they did not they would not get
it. For journalists only advertise those who
supply the advertisements. Mrs. Eames was
wise enough to know this, but also wise enough
to pretend she did not.
</p>

<p>
"It must be most trying," she said. "That's
the worst of being famous. Now what about
your photo of the cave? I mustn't interrupt
you by chattering here. Would you like me to
pose for you as a pirate? I mean to say a
smuggler. A real live smuggler seated on a
stone at the entrance of the cave would be
rather a catch in your book, wouldn't it?"
</p>

<p>
Sir Evelyn did not think it would, and tried
to say so politely.
</p>

<p>
"I see what you mean," said Mrs. Eames.
"My figure, of course. It's too plump for even
a well-to-do smuggler. What you want is someone
lean. Now if poor Timothy were here&mdash;&mdash; But
he's too mild-looking for a smuggler. It is
a pity about my figure."
</p>

<p>
She surveyed her own legs with a good-humoured
smile.
</p>

<p>
"It's not that," said Sir Evelyn, though it
was. "All I meant to say is that I'd like
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_36' name='Page_36'>[36]</a></span>
to take a separate photograph of you afterwards,
a portrait."
</p>

<p>
He felt that he had been rude, and there was
nothing he disliked more than failing in courtesy
to a woman.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Eames clapped her hands.
</p>

<p>
"For publication, of course," she said.
"'Mrs. Eames takes a dip at Deauville.' We
must say Deauville. Beth knows all about
these things, being a journalist herself; and she
says that this sort of photo practically must be
at Deauville if it's to get into any really smart
paper."
</p>

<p>
"But do you want that?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course I do," said Mrs. Eames, "and it
won't do to say 'Mrs. Eames taking a dip,'
even at Deauville. We'll say 'Agatha Eames,'
and then if people don't know who I am they'll
feel they ought to and pretend they do. Or
perhaps 'Lady Agatha Eames.' I don't think
there'd be any harm in that, do you? 'Lady
Agatha Eames in the smartest of chic bathing
suits taking her morning dip at Deauville.
Photo'd by Sir Evelyn Dent.' You'd like that,
wouldn't you?"
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_37' name='Page_37'>[37]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"I don't think I should," said Sir Evelyn,
rather alarmed. "In fact, I'm sure I
shouldn't."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Eames was a little downcast, but bore
her disappointment well.
</p>

<p>
"I quite understand," she said. "My bathing
dress isn't really chic, and it's centuries
old. Of course, you wouldn't like to be associated
with it in any public way."
</p>

<p>
"It's not that," said Sir Evelyn feebly.
</p>

<p>
"And my figure," said Mrs. Eames. "It is
unfortunate about my figure. And you
wouldn't believe the amount of exercise I take
in order to keep it down. I quite see that it
wouldn't do for a Deauville bathing photo.
I'll just slip off behind a rock and get my
clothes on while you're photographing the cave."
</p>

<p>
She put on her bathing cap and plunged into
the pool again. A few swift strokes took her
to the other side. Sir Evelyn watched her
disappear into the cave with a bundle of clothes
and a bathing towel in her arms. He adjusted
his camera and took three photographs.
</p>

<p>
A quarter of an hour later Mrs. Eames came
scrambling over the rocks at the mouth of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_38' name='Page_38'>[38]</a></span>
pool. She was dressed, but it struck Sir Evelyn
when he saw her that her clothes tended rather
to emphasise than disguise the defects of figure
she complained of. On the upper part of her
body she wore a low-necked, entirely sleeveless
knitted jumper of a bright yellow colour. A
blue cotton skirt barely reached her knees.
Her stockings, which seemed stretched to their
uttermost, were of the colour called "nude"
by hosiers, and it was impossible to help looking
at them because her shoes were very white and
caught the eye.
</p>

<p>
"Now for lunch," she said. "You'll lunch
with us, of course."
</p>

<p>
"I fear," said Sir Evelyn vaguely. "I fear
that to-day&mdash;&mdash; Perhaps some other day&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, but you must," said Mrs. Eames.
"Think of poor Timothy. He hardly ever has
the chance of meeting anyone. Not that he
wants to, poor darling. In fact he hates it.
But it's so good for him."
</p>

<p>
This tangled account of the vicar's feelings
about strangers confirmed Sir Evelyn in his
determination to go back to the Anchor Inn
for luncheon. He had no wish to force his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_39' name='Page_39'>[39]</a></span>
company on an unwilling host, and did not
feel it in any way his duty to be "good" for
the Rev. Timothy Eames.
</p>

<p>
"I have made arrangements," he said a little
stiffly, "to lunch at the inn."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, that'll be all right," said Mrs. Eames,
"I'll explain to James Hinton. As a matter of
fact, he'll quite expect you to lunch at the
vicarage. Everybody who comes to the village
does. Not that anyone ever does come. At
least, very seldom. But if anybody did&mdash;and,
after all, you have&mdash;he would lunch at the
vicarage. James Hinton knows that quite
well."
</p>

<p>
James Hinton did. Sir Evelyn remembered
that.
</p>

<p>
Further refusal became impossible when Mrs.
Eames hooked her arm through his and began
to tow him across the stony beach.
</p>

<p>
"There's only cold lamb," she said. "But
as soon as we get home I'll dart into the kitchen
and make some pancakes. I'm sure you like
pancakes. Don't you like pancakes?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, quite," said Sir Evelyn.
</p>

<p>
"And scrambled eggs. Scrambled eggs don't
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_40' name='Page_40'>[40]</a></span>
take a minute. After photographing the cave
you're sure to be hungry. I know I am.
Gladys can run down to the inn for a jug of
beer."
</p>

<p>
"Gladys!"
</p>

<p>
"Gladys," said Mrs. Eames, "is our cook,
which she can't, not even scrambled eggs;
and housemaid, which she won't, though she
could if she liked. But she can and will go
down to James Hinton's for a jug of beer when
I tell her to."
</p>

<h2>Chapter III</h2>

<p>
"While I'm making the pancakes," said
Mrs. Eames, as they crossed the green where
the nets and geese were, "you might give
Timothy a bit of a talking to; stir him up,
you know. I'm always trying to, but I've
never succeeded in the least. A word or two
from you&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I do not think it at all likely that I should
influence him," said Sir Evelyn stiffly.
</p>

<p>
He had no idea of taking on the task of
stimulating into activity a lazy country vicar.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_41' name='Page_41'>[41]</a></span>
That was what the Rev. Timothy Eames seemed
to be.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, but you could," said Mrs. Eames.
"Force of good example, you know. Tell him
you're writing a book, and then, very likely,
he'll write one too. He could if he chose. I
was sitting beside a Dean once at tea&mdash;not
quite a first-rate Dean, but still fairly important&mdash;and
I heard him say to another Dean that
there is a corner to be made in the Christological
heresies, if anyone cared to seize the chance.
I remembered that and told Timothy afterwards,
hoping that he might go in for it."
</p>

<p>
"Might make a corner?"
</p>

<p>
"Exactly. Just what you're doing, you
know. I don't say Christological heresies are as
good as smugglers. They're not. But a corner
is a corner whatever it's in. My idea was that
Timothy might dart in before anyone else
tumbled to the chance, and corner those
heretics. I know he can read Greek, for I've
seen him do it, and so far as I can make out
that's the only qualification required. Do try
and persuade him, won't you?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid&mdash;&mdash;"
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_42' name='Page_42'>[42]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"You needn't be," said Mrs. Eames. "Timothy
won't resent anything you say. He isn't
the kind of man who resents good advice. I
give him lots and lots, and he's never even
annoyed. He simply lies down under it. Such
a pity, when he really can read Greek, a thing
very few can do."
</p>

<p>
They passed through the gateway of the
vicarage&mdash;the gate itself had long ago decayed
away&mdash;and walked up an ill-kept drive. They
found the vicar seated on a rickety chair in
front of the house. He had a book in his hand,
perhaps a Greek book, but instead of reading
it he was gazing at the sea with mild, watery
eyes. He stood up as his wife and Sir Evelyn
approached, and showed himself to be a tall,
gaunt man. He rose slowly to an incredible
height, and then seemed to shrink again as he
relapsed into his habitual stoop. Mrs. Eames
was fluent and explanatory in her introduction.
</p>

<p>
"This is Sir Evelyn Dent," she said, "and
he has come to luncheon. He was a very
eminent Cabinet Minister until the Government
was hoofed out, which wasn't his fault, and
happens to all Governments sooner or later.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_43' name='Page_43'>[43]</a></span>
What do you think Sir Evelyn did then, Timothy?
He sat straight down to historical research
of the most abstruse kind. There's an
example for you! Now, Sir Evelyn, you talk
to him about Christological heresies while I go
and make the pancakes. You'll hardly believe
it, but I've put the advantages of that corner
of the Dean's before him dozens of times and
he hasn't done a thing yet, not even ragged
a Monophysite, though that must be an
easy enough thing for anyone who knows
Greek."
</p>

<p>
She ran into the house, leaving two embarrassed
men behind her. Sir Evelyn, though
a man of the world and practised in dealing
with awkward situations, stood tongue-tied.
The vicar, sighing gently, looked at his visitor,
apparently waiting for the scolding which he
felt he deserved. It was he who first broke
the silence.
</p>

<p>
"Do you find the Christological controversies
really interesting?" he asked mildly.
</p>

<p>
"Interesting!" Sir Evelyn was a little
irritable. "Good heavens, no! I don't even
know what Christological controversies are. I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_44' name='Page_44'>[44]</a></span>
never heard of them till Mrs. Eames mentioned
them to me ten minutes ago."
</p>

<p>
"Oh," said the vicar. "I thought Agatha
said that you and some Dean were going into
the subject together. I must have been mistaken.
But I'm often mistaken, in fact&mdash;generally,
especially about things Agatha says.
She will talk fast and jump about from one
thing to another."
</p>

<p>
"My subject," said Sir Evelyn, beginning
to recover himself, "is Eighteenth Century
Smuggling."
</p>

<p>
"And is that interesting? But, of course, it
must be to you, or you wouldn't take it up.
I suppose that any subject would be interesting
if only one succeeded in getting started, even
the Christological heresies. But we needn't
talk about them, at least not until Agatha
comes back. Indeed we needn't even then
unless we want to. She will do all the talking
necessary. So restful for us. Don't you think
so?"
</p>

<p>
Sir Evelyn did not. He liked talking, and
held the view, taken by St. Paul, that women
ought to keep silence. They are at their best
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_45' name='Page_45'>[45]</a></span>
when listening, respectfully, to what men like
Sir Evelyn have to say.
</p>

<p>
"The Hailey Compton cave," he began, as if
delivering a public lecture, "which I came
here to-day to investigate, was undoubtedly
much used by smugglers. Its situation, close
to a remote village difficult of access, rendered
it peculiarly suitable for their lawless trade.
Its great size and the ease with which it can be
approached from the sea at high tide, help to
mark it out as one of the places...."
</p>

<p>
Long before he had finished what he had to
say about the Hailey Compton cave Mrs. Eames
came from the house again.
</p>

<p>
"So lucky," she said. "I found Gladys's
aunt in the kitchen, so I just scrambled the
eggs and left her to make the pancakes. I
expect she can all right. Anyhow, she'll be
better than Gladys, and quite as good as me.
She has nine children, so she must be able
to make pancakes. What I mean to say is that
a woman who can bring up nine children can
do anything. And now, Sir Evelyn, do tell
me all about London. Timothy, darling, get
a couple more chairs, and we'll all sit down
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_46' name='Page_46'>[46]</a></span>
and be comfortable. We can't have lunch till
the pancakes are ready and Gladys has fetched
the beer."
</p>

<p>
The vicar, who seemed obedient in most
things though rebellious over the Christological
heresies, shambled into the house in search of
chairs.
</p>

<p>
"I'm just longing," said Mrs. Eames, "to
hear all about the latest music and art. I
really live for music though, of course, I never
hear any, and I worship&mdash;&mdash;" She looked
round and saw that her husband had not
yet come out of the house. "Timothy isn't
here, so I don't mind saying that I worship
the theatre. I hope you don't think it very
wrong of me to say 'worship,' on account of the
second commandment, and me being a clergyman's
wife. Though, of course, the theatre
isn't a graven or molten image, is it? Still,
Timothy mightn't quite like my saying it,
although it's true. Now what do you think
about that, Sir Evelyn?"
</p>

<p>
Sir Evelyn evaded the point, a thing which
his long practice in politics enabled him to
do without any difficulty. He did not feel
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_47' name='Page_47'>[47]</a></span>
equal to deciding whether the second commandment
forbids the worship of the theatre.
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid," he said, "that you have not
much chance of indulging your taste for the
drama down here."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, but I have," said Mrs. Eames.
"Timothy says I indulge it too much. But I
always tell him something must be done for
the good of the parish, and as he won't, I do.
The year before last we had 'Macbeth,' acted
entirely by the village people. I do think
Shakespeare is so educative, don't you? Last
year we had 'Othello,' and now we're getting
up 'Hamlet.' Oh, here's Timothy coming back
with some chairs. Now we'll be able to sit
down and listen to you, Sir Evelyn. I always
say that the greatest pleasure in life is hearing
a clever man talk, a really clever man. Timothy,
darling, Sir Evelyn thinks that we never have
any plays here. But we do, don't we?"
</p>

<p>
The vicar, shambling along with two chairs
dragged behind him, stopped when appealed to.
</p>

<p>
"Plays!" he said. "Oh, yes, certainly.
Almost too many of them."
</p>

<p>
"I always think," said Mrs. Eames, "that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_48' name='Page_48'>[48]</a></span>
Shakespeare is so much better done in the open
air by simple country people. More Elizabethan
in spirit. I'm sure you agree with me about
that."
</p>

<p>
"I should have supposed," said Sir Evelyn,
a little stiffly, "that it would have been difficult
to get a satisfactory local Hamlet."
</p>

<p>
"Not a bit," said Mrs. Eames. "There's a
man here called Hinton, the landlord of the
inn&mdash;but you've seen him, haven't you?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Then I'm sure you agree with me," said
Mrs. Eames, "that he's a perfect natural
Hamlet&mdash;figure, manner, face, voice, everything.
You ought to see him in the grave-digger scene&mdash;and
you shall. This isn't the regular day for
rehearsals, but we'll have one after lunch. I'll
send Gladys round to tell everyone. It'll be so
good for us all to hear what you have to say.
I'm doing the Queen, Hamlet's mother, you
know. I'd have liked to do Ophelia; but that
was scarcely possible with my figure."
</p>

<p>
She sat down abruptly on a low deck chair
which the vicar had dragged out. Her skirt
was a barely sufficient covering when she
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_49' name='Page_49'>[49]</a></span>
stood up. It was very insufficient when she
sat down in a low chair. She was conscious
of that but not at all embarrassed.
</p>

<p>
"You simply couldn't have an Ophelia with
legs like those," she said.
</p>

<p>
Sir Evelyn agreed with her, but was not
obliged to say so, for Gladys's aunt put her
head out of the kitchen window and shouted
that luncheon was ready.
</p>

<p>
"Has Gladys come back with the beer?"
said Mrs. Eames.
</p>

<p>
The aunt said she was at that moment coming
in through the back door with a jug in her
hand.
</p>

<p>
"I do hope it'll turn out that Gladys's aunt
can make pancakes," said Mrs. Eames as they
went into the house. "Gladys can't. But
these things don't always run in families, which
is a pity. If I could write for the papers like
Beth&mdash;she is my niece, Sir Evelyn, not Timothy's&mdash;we
might be quite rich. But I can't; which
just shows that there's not so much in heredity
as some people say, and proves that Gladys's
aunt may be able to make pancakes. Anyhow,
let's try."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_50' name='Page_50'>[50]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Gladys, a failure as a cook and unwilling to
make beds, appeared to be quite incompetent
as a parlourmaid. Mrs. Eames was obliged to
run round the table with plates and dishes,
while Gladys, grinning foolishly, followed her
with the beer. This gave Sir Evelyn a chance
of resuming the monologue about smugglers'
caves which had been interrupted by Mrs.
Eames.
</p>

<p>
"There are," he said, "several hundred so-called
smugglers' caves on the south coast of
England. Few of them, perhaps not more than
eighty or ninety altogether, were actually ever
used for the storing of contraband goods. All
the rest are spurious, advertised by the local
hotel-keepers and railway companies as attractions
to the trippers. They are rapidly becoming
popular features of our watering-places.
Picnic parties throng them. Campers pitch
tents in their vicinity."
</p>

<p>
The vicar, who was drooping slowly at the
head of the table, sighed. The thought of
picnic parties swarming into the Hailey Compton
cave filled him with horror. Mrs. Eames
became interested. She was hovering over the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_51' name='Page_51'>[51]</a></span>
cold lamb with a carving knife in her hand.
She paused to consider a splendid prospect.
Crowds of trippers, if they could be attracted to
Hailey Compton, would provide audiences for
her plays, and audiences were so far just what
the plays lacked. A vision of Hailey Compton
as a sort of Shakespearean Ober-Ammergau,
floated through her mind.
</p>

<p>
"The claims of your cave," Sir Evelyn went
on, bowing politely to the vicar, "can certainly
be substantiated at the bar of history."
</p>

<p>
A man gains this advantage by being an
experienced public speaker. He is able to use
phrases like "Substantiated at the bar of history"
without suffering, though not, of course,
without causing suffering to others. The
ordinary speech of an experienced politician
contains hundreds of similar phrases; and in
his use of them he is like a surgeon who can do
the most disgusting things to the human body
without the slightest feeling of nausea because
he has become thoroughly accustomed to doing
them. In the same way a Cabinet Minister can
use phrases, not only without self-contempt,
but even with a glow of satisfaction, which make
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_52' name='Page_52'>[52]</a></span>
other men sick. How splendid it must be to be
able to say "The answer is in the negative"
without vomiting!
</p>

<p>
"Timothy," said Mrs. Eames while Sir Evelyn
had his mouth full of scrambled egg, "why
hasn't our cave been advertised? I'm always
telling you that something ought to be done for
the parish. As vicar you're simply bound to do
something. Here's a splendid opportunity for
you. Advertise the cave."
</p>

<p>
Sir Evelyn held up his hand in gentle but
firm protest against Mrs. Eames's interruptions.
He still had a great deal to say and he meant to
say it all. It was a contest for the privilege of
talking, and Sir Evelyn's steady flow of words
reduced Mrs. Eames to silence for a time.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps mere persistence would not have won
the victory. Sir Evelyn was more than persevering
and monotonous. He was interesting
and showed that he possessed a gift for picturesque
description. Having proved that the
Hailey Compton cave really had been used by
smugglers, he went on to give an account,
imaginary but based on laboriously studied facts,
of the landing of a cargo of contraband goods.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_53' name='Page_53'>[53]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
He did it so well that even the vicar was
slightly interested. Mrs. Eames, who might
have sat down and eaten her luncheon, stood
with a dish of potatoes in her hand, thrilled.
Even Gladys stopped clattering plates together
on the sideboard. Sir Evelyn, like all good
talkers, responded to the sympathy of his
audience. He spoke better than he ever
remembered speaking before.
</p>

<p>
A dark autumn night. A sighing wind. The
hoarse roar of sullen waves dragging at the
stones on the beach. A watcher on the tower
of the church. The flash of a light far out at
sea. A flare on the church tower, subsiding,
flaming up again. Glimmering lights in cottage
windows. The trampling of heavily booted feet
across the beach. The glowing of lanterns. A
gathering of dim figures under the arch of the
cave, the sharp rattle of horsehoofs on the
stony path which led down the cliff to the
village. (Sir Evelyn's own experiences earlier
in the day helped him to realise what that descent
was like.) A gathering of led pack horses,
whinnying and neighing, on the short grass
where now the nets are spread. The continuous
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_54' name='Page_54'>[54]</a></span>
flashing of a ship's light near at hand.
Answering flashes from the mouth of the cave.
All the while the hollow booming of the sea.
(Sir Evelyn had a good voice, resonant and
thrilling like the tones of a 'cello and he was
telling his story well.) The appearance of
blacker shadows, huge, menacing, against the
blackness of the night&mdash;the great sails of the
lugger. The rattle of blocks and the whining
of running ropes. Muttered orders. The slow
in-gliding of the boat. The making fast of
mooring ropes.
</p>

<p>
This was part of one of the few chapters in
Sir Evelyn's book which was already written.
He had worked at it so long and revised it so
often that he knew it off by heart. He thought
it a fine piece of writing, and it certainly seemed
good to his audience. Perhaps it is only because
they despise their audiences that our
statesmen talk stale jargon in Parliament and
on platforms. When they sit down to write,
hoping to be read by intelligent men and
women, they are very often capable of producing
good English.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_55' name='Page_55'>[55]</a></span>
</p>

<h2>Chapter IV</h2>

<p>
There were incidents in the story which might
have been cavilled at by a cold-blooded critic.
There were, as Sir Evelyn went on, inconsistencies.
Men who had tramped across bare
rolling stones were splashing knee-deep in water
a little later, as if the tide had come in with
startling rapidity. On so calm a night there
was surely no need for the lugger to carry
ballast outboard, though the description of the
kegs slung along her weather gunwale helped to
produce an atmosphere of very proper desperation.
But what do such details matter? Sir
Evelyn had achieved the spirit of the smugglers'
night landing; worked up to quite unusual
emotion he might have gone on to a fight with
the preventive officers, but Mrs. Eames, uncontrollably
excited, interrupted him at
last.
</p>

<p>
"I see it all," she cried, clapping her hands.
"It's wonderful, Sir Evelyn, thrilling. Timothy,
we must have a pageant&mdash;the Hailey Compton
Pageant of Smuggling days. The first of a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_56' name='Page_56'>[56]</a></span>
series of Hailey Compton Pageants of English
History. Smugglers! They've never been
done before."
</p>

<p>
To Sir Evelyn her voice was like a jug of cold
water suddenly emptied over him. His delight
in his own story faded away. He was conscious
of nothing except that he had been betrayed
into making a fool of himself.
</p>

<p>
The vicar groaned aloud.
</p>

<p>
"My dear Agatha&mdash;&mdash;" he began.
</p>

<p>
"Don't croak, Timothy," she cried, "and
don't cavil. This is going to be the most
splendid pageant there ever was. The real thing.
All the cinemas in the world will reproduce it.
We'll have half England here to see it."
</p>

<p>
"Terrible, terrible," said the vicar.
</p>

<p>
"We'll make pots of money&mdash;for the church
of course, Timothy."
</p>

<p>
"The church doesn't want money," said the
vicar; but he knew even while he sobbed out
the words, that this was not true. All churches
want money, always, and when they get it
immediately want more. So do states. If a
church or a state could be found which did not
want money all sensible men would immediately
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_57' name='Page_57'>[57]</a></span>
be received into the one and naturalised into the
other.
</p>

<p>
"Timothy, dearest," said Mrs. Eames, "you
know the church ought to be restored. You
can't imagine," she explained to Sir Evelyn,
"how utterly Victorian our church is. It's quite
impossible to have really catholic services in it in
its present state. But if we only had money to
restore it&mdash;and we will, thanks to your splendid
idea of a smuggling pageant."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Eames, a fervent admirer of all that was
best in drama, music and art, was in full sympathy
with the picturesque part of the Anglo-Catholic
movement in the Church. If she had
not been a vicar's wife she would probably have
become Catholic without the Anglo. This shows
the wisdom of the Church of England in encouraging
the marriage of her clergy. A taste
for ornamental ecclesiasticism would doubtless
lead many women to desert the church of their
baptism, if it were not that such women generally
get married early in life to curates. And
how many of our priests&mdash;blessed with similar
tastes and an equal share of intelligence&mdash;would
make their submission to seductive Rome
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_58' name='Page_58'>[58]</a></span>
if they were not irrevocably tied to women by
a bond which they regard as sacramental?
</p>

<p>
"God forbid," said the vicar solemnly, "that
I should ever be guilty of restoring the church.
I have," his voice became penitential, "I have
many sins to answer for, but at least&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Eames laid down the potato dish which
she still held in her hands, ran to him and flung
a plump arm round his neck.
</p>

<p>
"Timothy, darling," she said, "you haven't
any sins or shortcomings. I sometimes think
you'd be a better man if you had a few. But
you haven't."
</p>

<p>
"At least," said the vicar, pushing his mouth
clear of the hands which covered it, "it shall
never be recorded of me that I restored a
church. I beg of you, Agatha, to allow me to
die without doing that."
</p>

<p>
He spoke as all good clergy do of church
restoration. There is scarcely a vicar or rector
to be found in England to-day who does not
resent the restoration of his church effected by
his predecessor. So far has æsthetic education
advanced in our time. So far, but no farther.
For there is scarcely a vicar or a rector who does
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_59' name='Page_59'>[59]</a></span>
not feel that if the restoration had been left to
him it would have been done properly; who
would not joyfully undertake a fresh restoration
if he saw his way to getting the money.
But Mr. Eames at least was sincere. The furniture
and fittings of Hailey Compton church
deserved the worst that could be said of them,
but the vicar would not willingly have removed
a pew or erected a screen.
</p>

<p>
He got up slowly and sadly, releasing himself
from his wife's encircling arms. With a bow to
Sir Evelyn he turned to leave the room.
</p>

<p>
"Timothy, Timothy," said Mrs. Eames,
"don't go till you've had a pancake."
</p>

<p>
She turned on Gladys who was making a
cheerful noise by knocking table-spoons against
the beer jug.
</p>

<p>
"Go and get the pancakes at once, Gladys.
Timothy, my darling, do stay."
</p>

<p>
"Not if I'm to be asked to restore a church,"
he said.
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid," said Sir Evelyn, when the vicar
had shut the door behind him, "that he doesn't
like the idea of a pageant."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, he's always that way at first," said Mrs.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_60' name='Page_60'>[60]</a></span>
Eames, "when I'm doing something for the
parish. He was perfectly miserable for a week
when I began the rehearsing for 'Othello,' pretending
that he didn't like my doing Desdemona.
He was just as bad over 'Hamlet,' though I said
I'd give up being Ophelia just to please him. I
cannot get him to see that it is his duty in a
parish like this to get up something for the
people. Don't you agree with me, Sir Evelyn?"
</p>

<p>
"The country clergy," said Sir Evelyn, "are
often reproached with apathy and indifference
to&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Exactly what I don't want to have said
about poor Timothy," said Mrs. Eames. "He's
really a saint, you know. At least he would be
if he'd only do something, even something
wrong. It is such a comfort," she went on
abruptly, "to feel that you're going to help us
in this pageant, Sir Evelyn."
</p>

<p>
"So far as my limited knowledge of the subject
goes," said Sir Evelyn, a little taken aback,
"it is entirely at your disposal, but&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Splendid," said Mrs. Eames, "and your
knowledge isn't the least limited, so don't be
modest. I'll get Beth to write articles for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_61' name='Page_61'>[61]</a></span>
every paper in England boosting the pageant for
all she's worth. That's what's called publicity,
and it's most important."
</p>

<p>
"But&mdash;&mdash;" said Sir Evelyn, "excuse my
interrupting you, Mrs. Eames, but&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Don't go on saying but. You're getting
nearly as bad as poor Timothy. Let's make out
a list of what we shall want. Ten smugglers
would be enough, I should think. Jack Bunce
and his son. That's two&mdash;&mdash;" She ticked off
the Hailey Compton fishermen on her fingers as
she named them. "Tommy Whittle and his
three brothers. The youngest is what's called
mentally deficient, but that won't matter in a
business like this. Old George Mullens&mdash;his
beard will look splendid. Charlie Mees. He's
lame; but I suppose a smuggler might be lame.
How many's that?"
</p>

<p>
"But," said Sir Evelyn, "oughtn't we to
begin by considering&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"One lugger," Mrs. Eames went on. "It
may be a little difficult to get a lugger. Ten
pack horses. I haven't the least idea what a
pack horse is, but I suppose an ordinary horse
will do if it's dressed up properly. Everybody
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_62' name='Page_62'>[62]</a></span>
will have to dress up of course. Fifty or sixty
kegs. I suppose Harrod's will be able to supply
us with kegs. They sell everything."
</p>

<p>
"But," said Sir Evelyn desperately, "where's
the money to come from?"
</p>

<p>
"The public, of course," said Mrs. Eames.
"The public is going to pay enormous sums."
</p>

<p>
"I was thinking of preliminary expenses,"
said Sir Evelyn.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, they won't be much," said Mrs. Eames
cheerfully, "and I think we'll easily be able to
get a grant from some society. Look at the
number of societies there are which go in for
encouraging artistic handicrafts for the people.
Now don't interrupt me, Sir Evelyn. I know
just as well as you do that a pageant isn't a
handicraft, but it's the same sort of thing. It's
just as good as folk dancing anyhow, and there's
always money going for that, and folk songs.
We'll introduce a folk dance and a few folk
songs if necessary. Then there are all the people
who want to revive national drama. This is
national drama."
</p>

<p>
Sir Evelyn, though inclined to be critical,
was impressed. There are enormous numbers
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_63' name='Page_63'>[63]</a></span>
of people, most of them incorporated into
societies, who are willing to give money, of
which they seem to have more than they want,
for just such enterprises as Mrs. Eames's. There
ought not to be any great difficulty about
getting at them.
</p>

<p>
"And of course," said Mrs. Eames, "we can
get a grant from the County Education Committee."
</p>

<p>
"That," said Sir Evelyn firmly, "would be
totally impossible."
</p>

<p>
This light-hearted suggestion of pillaging
public funds came perilously near being an
insult when made to a man who was once a
Cabinet Minister. Sir Evelyn resented it and
showed his feelings in his voice. Mrs. Eames
was in no way abashed.
</p>

<p>
"I don't see why not," she said. "A pageant
is a most educative thing. No one can possibly
deny that. Lots and lots of money is spent on
things which aren't nearly so educative as our
pageant will be. I mean educative in the true
sense of the word."
</p>

<p>
Everyone who says educative and education
means the words to be understood in this way.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_64' name='Page_64'>[64]</a></span>
The thought of the "true sense" mollified Sir
Evelyn a little. It soothes everyone who has
anything to do with education, except the public
which has to pay for it. It realises that education
in the "true sense" is more expensive than any
other. Mrs. Eames saw that she had produced
a good effect and pressed her advantage.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sure we'd get a grant from the committee,"
she said, "if you asked for it."
</p>

<p>
Sir Evelyn was most uncomfortably conscious
that this was true. A suggestion from
him would go a long way with any County
Committee, and if he described Mrs. Eames's
pageant as an educational enterprise everyone
would at once believe him. Unfortunately,
having been a gentleman before he became a
politician, he was afflicted with a certain sense
of honesty.
</p>

<p>
"It's only a matter of its being put properly
to the proper people," said Mrs. Eames persuasively,
"and you can do that easily."
</p>

<p>
"I'd rather give you fifty pounds myself,"
said Sir Evelyn desperately, "than ask for a
grant from any public fund."
</p>

<p>
"How perfectly sweet of you," said Mrs.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_65' name='Page_65'>[65]</a></span>
Eames. "Now there needn't be any worry
about money. There can't be much more
wanted. Timothy will be delighted when I
tell him. He's always just a little inclined to
fuss about money, and these things do cost
something, don't they? I wish I could tell
him about your fifty pounds at once and make
his mind easy. But he's up in the church and
I simply daren't disturb him."
</p>

<p>
"In the church?"
</p>

<p>
Sir Evelyn was impressed and quite understood
that a vicar&mdash;admittedly on the verge
of becoming a saint&mdash;ought not to be disturbed
while engaged in prayer and meditation.
</p>

<p>
"Locked in," said Mrs. Eames. "He always
locks himself into the church for a while when
I get up anything for the parish. So naughty
of him, but that's the kind of man he is. However
I'll tell him about your fifty pounds when
he comes home in the evening."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Eames was perfectly right in saying that
her husband had locked himself in. But Sir
Evelyn's inference was wrong. Mr. Eames was
not engaged in devotional exercises. He was
reading the works of the philosopher Epictetus&mdash;a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_66' name='Page_66'>[66]</a></span>
very wise choice of literature, for no writer,
ancient or modern, has more comfort to offer
to those who suffer from the worries and minor
ills of life. Nervous irritability, impotent anger
and such afflictions of temper are almost
invariably soothed by a study of the excellent
teaching of Epictetus. Mr. Eames read the
philosopher in Greek, which is the best way to
read him, for no one can read Greek very fast,
and the necessity of going slowly in order to
understand the words gives time for the
digestion of the matter behind them.
</p>

<p>
There is nothing irreverent or even improper
about reading Epictetus in church. He was a
pagan, but so nearly a Christian that the
mediæval monks mistook him for one of the
fathers of the church and treated his works
as books of devotion. If the monks of the
sainted Middle Ages took this view of Epictetus
a twentieth century English vicar who reads
him in church cannot be regarded as profane.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Eames, owing to the unrestored condition
of his church, was able to make himself
fairly comfortable while reading. Hailey
Compton parish church was built originally in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_67' name='Page_67'>[67]</a></span>
the Early English style, and was refurnished
every hundred years or so in accordance with
the taste of each period. The Victorian churchwardens,
when their turn came, filled it with
large high-backed square pews, put thick
cushions on the seats and provided footstools
for the convenience of worshippers with short
legs. There were fireplaces in some of the
pews and occasionally there were arm-chairs.
To avoid draughts and secure privacy red
curtains were hung round the principal pews.
The leading idea was the physical comfort of
the worshippers, and the churchwardens seemed
to have held with Bishop Blougram that soul
was at its best when "body gets its sop and
holds its noise." No one need be ashamed of
being a disciple of Bishop Blougram, who was
a most successful ecclesiastic, on the way to
become a Cardinal or perhaps a Pope.
</p>

<p>
It was in one of these great square pews that
Mr. Eames settled down with his Epictetus.
He shut the door. He drew the curtains. He
sat at ease in an arm-chair with his outstretched
feet on a stool. A thick, though
dirty carpet covered the floor. A man might
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_68' name='Page_68'>[68]</a></span>
have a worse study if he were content to read
without smoking. When Mr. Eames felt that
a full appreciation of Epictetus required
tobacco he went out and smoked a pipe, sitting
on a tombstone.
</p>

<p>
This pew, the largest and best furnished in
the church, had its place in the chancel, close
to the altar rails. It had been dedicated a
century or so before to the use of the lord of
the manor. But for many years there had
been no lord of the manor or resident squire in
Hailey Compton. The pew was therefore unused
except by the vicar when he retired for a
while from the turmoil of his wife's activities.
</p>

<h2>Chapter V</h2>

<p>
It is a depressing fact and something of a
disgrace to human nature that the efforts of
those who try to benefit their neighbours are
seldom appreciated. Our most active benefactors
are generally unpopular. Reformers of
a serious kind, those who try to rid the world
of beer, tobacco and the opportunity of betting,
no doubt expect to be detested, and reckon the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_69' name='Page_69'>[69]</a></span>
dislike they incur as part of the reward of their
virtue. At all events they richly deserve all
they get in the way of unpopularity. But it is
hard on those much less culpable people who
merely insist on others amusing themselves in
unaccustomed ways that their efforts should
earn no gratitude.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Eames, for instance, had no objection
to beer, often smoked cigarettes and might have
bet small sums if the temptation had come her
way. She did nothing worse in the village
than stir up young men and maidens to act
plays; which they ought to have liked doing
but did not. She was not herself unpopular,
but her plays were, and the announcement
that a fresh one was to be started, was received
year after year with groans from those likely
to be implicated, and from the whole community
with a stolid passive resistance, which only
energy as unfailing as Mrs. Eames's could
possibly have overcome.
</p>

<p>
She knew all this and fully expected that the
pageant prospect would be received by the
village people with mutterings of revolt. It
was. Mrs. Eames, who believed in what she
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_70' name='Page_70'>[70]</a></span>
called personal influence, made a rapid visitation
of the village, explained the glories and
delights of pageants, and was met almost
everywhere with gloomy hostility. Only James
Hinton of the Anchor Inn gave her the least
encouragement, and even his reception of the
project would scarcely have been called encouraging
except by contrast to the hostility
elsewhere. Hinton, at least, did not condemn
the pageant without hearing what it was to
be. He questioned Mrs. Eames about it and
finally promised to think the matter over
carefully.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Eames summoned a public meeting to
consider the pageant and to make the necessary
arrangements.
</p>

<p>
This was always her way of proceeding. She
liked public meetings because they gave her
opportunities for making speeches, and she
believed, like most English people, that a
meeting is as necessary to an undertaking of
any kind as trousers are to a man. There
would be something indecent about a scheme
which came into the world not clothed in a
resolution of approval, duly passed, not
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_71' name='Page_71'>[71]</a></span>
adorned with a properly appointed treasurer
and secretary.
</p>

<p>
A Tuesday ten days after Sir Evelyn's visit
was fixed for the meeting and the schoolroom
was chosen as the place of assembly.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Eames did not expect a large audience.
While discussing the meeting beforehand with
her husband she was able to predict with
complete confidence who would be there.
</p>

<p>
"James Hinton, of course," she said. "He's
your churchwarden."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose he's more or less bound to be
there," said the vicar, "to represent me. I'm
certainly not going."
</p>

<p>
"Of course not, darling. Everyone knows
you hate meetings and you wouldn't be any
use if you did go. I'm sure the school teachers
will be there. They always come to all meetings."
</p>

<p>
The schoolmaster and his two assistant damsels
attended Mrs. Eames's meetings regularly.
The schoolmaster liked proposing resolutions.
His assistants took it in turns to second anything
he proposed.
</p>

<p>
"And Mrs. Mudge," Mrs. Eames went on,
"and Mrs. Purly and&mdash;&mdash;"
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_72' name='Page_72'>[72]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
She named half a dozen old women, all of
them widows, all of them mildly pious, with a
vague feeling that attendance at any meeting
summoned by Mrs. Eames was a religious act.
</p>

<p>
"And some of the schoolboys."
</p>

<p>
"They only go because they're allowed to
shout," said the vicar. "All boys love shouting
anywhere, and it's particularly pleasant to
be able to yell in the schoolroom where they
generally have to sit quiet."
</p>

<p>
"Of course they love shouting, poor dears,"
said Mrs. Eames, "and I love to hear them.
Besides, Timothy, darling, a meeting is so dull
if nobody cheers. A speaker does want a little
encouragement. Of course it wouldn't do&mdash;I
know quite well it wouldn't do&mdash;but all the
same I often think that most sermons would be
better&mdash;not yours, Timothy&mdash;they couldn't be
nicer than they are&mdash;but most other sermons
would be far better if the choir boys were
allowed to cheer occasionally. They'd like it
and you can't think how it would encourage the
preacher."
</p>

<p>
"If nobody else goes to your meeting," said
the vicar, "and I'm sure nobody else will, I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_73' name='Page_73'>[73]</a></span>
don't see what good it is to hold a meeting at
all."
</p>

<p>
A surprise, staggering in its unexpectedness,
waited for Mrs. Eames when she went to her
meeting.
</p>

<p>
The schoolroom was full to its utmost
capacity. Indeed it had evidently been more
than full at some time shortly before the
beginning of the meeting. The schoolboys had
been turned out to make room for their elders.
Smarting under a sense of injustice they tried
to avenge themselves by marching round the
building and uttering howls of a lamentable
kind outside every window in turn. The schoolmaster,
though he deplored their action, refused
to interfere, saying that he had no authority
outside school hours. Others were less
scrupulous about their legal position. Tommy
Whittle, a burly fisherman, went out with a
stick and was using an argument which the
boys thoroughly understood when Mrs. Eames
arrived. Fortunately for the success of the
meeting Tommy Whittle had made his meaning
perfectly plain to the leading boys before he
followed Mrs. Eames into the room.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_74' name='Page_74'>[74]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
She was obliged to push her way through the
door, though everyone tried to make way for
her. Those who could not find seats were
crowded together at the bottom of the room,
and it was almost impossible for them to pack
any closer even in order to let Mrs. Eames pass.
Once well into the room she made a triumphal
progress towards the platform amidst bursts of
cheers, stamping of feet and clapping of hands.
On the platform, waiting to receive her, were
James Hinton and the schoolmaster, whom she
expected, and, an astonishing sight, Jack Bunce,
one of the oldest and most influential men in
the village, fellow churchwarden with James
Hinton. He had hitherto been obstinately
opposed to all Mrs. Eames's activities. All
three stood bowing low as she advanced
towards them.
</p>

<p>
James Hinton, holding up his hand for
silence, proposed that Mrs. Eames should take
the chair.
</p>

<p>
This was quite unnecessary. She took it of
her own accord, and as a matter of accustomed
right, as soon as she reached the platform.
</p>

<p>
Jack Bunce was seen&mdash;but owing to the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_75' name='Page_75'>[75]</a></span>
cheering, not heard&mdash;to be making a short
speech. It is likely that he was seconding
Hinton's proposition, very superfluously indeed,
but he may have been saying something
else. No one ever knew.
</p>

<p>
The size of the audience and the warmth of
her reception amazed Mrs. Eames. Never
before had she seen the people of Hailey
Compton stirred to the smallest interest in anything,
but there was no doubt about their
excited enthusiasm over the pageant. When
she began to speak they cheered every sentence.
</p>

<p>
"In times past," she said, "we have made
several efforts to revive drama in our village."
</p>

<p>
"Three cheers for drama," shouted Tommy
Whittle, waving the stick with which he had
beaten the boys, and the cheers were given.
</p>

<p>
"Shakespeare&mdash;&mdash;" said Mrs. Eames.
</p>

<p>
"Three cheers for Shakespeare," said old
Jack Bunce, who had always hated the plays.
</p>

<p>
"Shakespeare&mdash;&mdash;" said Mrs. Eames, when
the shouting subsided.
</p>

<p>
"Ladies and gentlemen," said Hinton, interrupting
her, "before we go further I think
that the name of the immortal Shakespeare
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_76' name='Page_76'>[76]</a></span>
should be received by all standing, in respectful
silence."
</p>

<p>
Only the boys outside broke the silence.
They had not been able to hear what Hinton
said.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Eames, despairing perhaps of ever getting
any further with that part of her speech,
dropped Shakespeare abruptly and went on to
speak of village art in general terms. The
applause was loud. She repeated one after
another things that she had said hundreds of
times and always to people who neither would
nor could understand what she meant. She
was perhaps no better understood at this
wonderful meeting, but what she said was
certainly approved.
</p>

<p>
Her eyes gleamed with delight. Her face
was flushed with excitement. She could feel
her heart beating in rapid throbs. But she
began to get a little hoarse from the effort to
make herself heard during the cheering. When
she had been talking for half an hour, about
art, song and dance, all of the "folk" or
superior kind, the audience began to show
signs of impatience. Instead of simply cheering,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_77' name='Page_77'>[77]</a></span>
the younger men at the back of the room
took to shouting "Pageant! Pageant!" They
pronounced the first syllable as if it rhymed
with rage, but there was no doubt about what
they meant. They wanted to get on, past art
of all kinds, to the proper business of the
meeting.
</p>

<p>
There was a good deal to say about the
pageant. And Mrs. Eames had matter enough,
if properly spun out, to keep her speech going
for another hour. She would have enjoyed
making an oration of that length and no doubt
would have done it if her voice had held out.
Unfortunately for her it failed. Few, if any,
human voices would have done any better.
The contest between a single speaker and a
cheering crowd is unequal and can only have
one end. Mrs. Eames sat down at last. Her
final words, muttered hoarsely, were, "Smugglers"&mdash;"old
days"&mdash;"Hailey Compton"&mdash;"hardy
breed of seadogs."
</p>

<p>
The cheers rose in a fine crescendo to a noise
which would have made a German orchestra
playing Wagner's music sound restrained and
soothing. The people were no doubt very glad
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_78' name='Page_78'>[78]</a></span>
that Mrs. Eames had reached the end of her
speech, but there must have been something
more than simple relief behind their cheering.
The ancestors of these fishermen, their grandfathers
and great grandfathers a century or so
before, had been noted smugglers, famous even
in an age when everyone in the south of
England smuggled. The deadening tyranny of
a hundred years of law and order had tamed
and cowed the Bunces and Whittles of to-day,
but deep down in them was the old spirit.
Mrs. Eames had appealed to sub-conscious
selves with atavistic memories.
</p>

<p>
The surprises of the evening were not at an
end. When Mrs. Eames sat down James
Hinton rose. He held in his hand a large piece
of paper and an observer in the audience might
have supposed that he intended to read a
speech. But Hinton had a spirit above manuscript
and it was very soon evident that the
paper contained something far more interesting
and more amazing than the notes of any speech.
</p>

<p>
"A pageant," he said gravely and with quiet
dignity, "a great pageant, a pageant displaying
one of the most glorious epochs of our national
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_79' name='Page_79'>[79]</a></span>
story&mdash;&mdash;" Cheers from such of the audience
as had any voices left stopped him for a moment.
"Such a pageant as we contemplate cannot be
run without the expenditure of considerable
sums in preliminary expenses."
</p>

<p>
At this point of the speech&mdash;a point which
must be reached in a speech made by someone
at every meeting convened for a good purpose&mdash;the
audience usually becomes uncomfortable
and often begins to melt away. But the
Hailey Compton people were apparently prepared
to face even a subscription list. They
cheered again. The reason of this confidence
was apparent almost at once. The subscription
list had been handed round days before and
was already complete.
</p>

<p>
"I have therefore much pleasure, madam,"
Hinton went on, bowing low to Mrs. Eames, "in
presenting to you a guarantee for the sum of
£51 2s. 6d. together with a list of the names
of the guarantors of what I may, perhaps, call
the Pageant Fund."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Eames gasped. In all her experience of
Hailey Compton&mdash;perhaps in all the experience
of all vicars and vicars' wives of all country
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_80' name='Page_80'>[80]</a></span>
parishes&mdash;no such thing as this had ever happened.
With the utmost difficulty she had
managed to extract sixpences and threepences
from unwilling people for the expenses of
"Macbeth" and "Othello." For "Hamlet" she
expected to have to pay entirely out of her own
pocket. Yet here, unasked for and unsought,
was more than fifty pounds offered to her.
</p>

<p>
She rose to her feet, tried to find words to
express at once gratitude and amazement.
She choked, swallowed hard, felt slightly faint
and sat down again abruptly. The emotion
of the evening had been too much for her.
Never before in her whole life had Mrs. Eames
been unable to express herself in fluent and
ready speech. But then she had never before
come face to face with a miracle.
</p>

<p>
The people cheered again, hoarsely, but as
fervently as ever. This time they felt that they
were cheering themselves. The £1 2s. 6d. represented
the subscription of the fishermen to the
fund. The fifty pounds came from Hinton.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_81' name='Page_81'>[81]</a></span>
</p>

<h2>Chapter VI</h2>

<p>
The meeting in the schoolroom lasted far
longer than any meeting in Hailey Compton had
ever lasted before. After all possible speeches
had been made and votes of thanks proposed
to everyone who could be supposed to deserve
such a compliment and to a good many people
who could not, there remained the business of
enrolling the performers for the pageant. This
was difficult, for almost everyone present
wanted to take part, and the boys, successfully
kept out until the speeches were over,
managed after that to force their way in and
added greatly to the confusion.
</p>

<p>
It was long after ten o'clock when Mrs.
Eames reached home. She hoped but scarcely
expected to find her husband waiting for her.
Mrs. Eames was a lady who delighted in talking
over everything she did at great length, and she
had no objection to sitting up until the early
hours of the morning. Her husband knew this,
as he knew most things about her after twelve
years of married life. He disliked talking,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_82' name='Page_82'>[82]</a></span>
which seemed to him a vain amusement, and
hated sitting up late. His plan, on the occasions
of evening meetings, was to go to bed
about nine o'clock and then pretend to be
asleep. On the evening of the pageant meeting
he really was asleep before his wife came home.
This did not altogether save him. Mrs. Eames
woke him. It was absolutely necessary to her
to discuss the astonishing events of the evening
with someone.
</p>

<p>
"Dearest one," she said, shaking him gently.
</p>

<p>
He groaned, turned over and buried his face
in the pillow.
</p>

<p>
"Darling Timothy," she said, "you must
wake up for just one minute. I want to tell you
what happened at the meeting this evening."
</p>

<p>
She shook him again, not so gently as at first,
and he opened his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"The whole village," she said, "was wildly
enthusiastic about the pageant, and James
Hinton has promised fifty pounds."
</p>

<p>
The vicar heard her and was almost startled
into complete wakefulness. But the mind,
though it works erratically, does work during
the interval of half consciousness between
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_83' name='Page_83'>[83]</a></span>
waking and sleeping. What Mrs. Eames said
was entirely incredible. The vicar took it for
granted that she could not really have said it.
He was, he supposed, dreaming a dream rather
more absurd than most dreams are.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes," he murmured, "how nice."
</p>

<p>
This seemed to him, still reasoning confusedly,
a very good answer to make to a dream statement
of a particularly foolish kind. It was not
an answer which satisfied Mrs. Eames. She
repeated, in much louder tones, her news about
the village people. She added details about
the meeting and described the extraordinary
enthusiasm of the audience. This time the
vicar was almost convinced he was awake and
tried to make up his mind to sit up and ask
questions. But Mrs. Eames repeated the statement
about James Hinton's fifty pounds and
the vicar's reason reasserted itself. It could
not be true that James Hinton had promised
fifty pounds to a pageant. If he seemed to
hear his wife saying such a thing it was plain
that he was still asleep and dreaming. With
a view to getting rid of what threatened to
become a nightmare he murmured again:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_84' name='Page_84'>[84]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"How nice! How very, very nice!"
</p>

<p>
Then he turned over again and shut his eyes
firmly. Mrs. Eames gave him up after that and
went down to the kitchen. Gladys, incompetent
cook and unwilling housemaid, was not
the listener she wanted. But Gladys would be
better than no one, and would be obliged to
listen to any story, however long, told by her
mistress.
</p>

<p>
Here luck favoured Mrs. Eames. She found
in the kitchen not only Gladys but the lady
whom Gladys called "My auntie," the very
lady who had made the pancakes for Sir Evelyn
Dent. While Gladys fussed about and made
tea for Mrs. Eames the "auntie" listened with
real interest to the story of the evening. Her
husband was one of those chosen to be a
smuggler. Her eldest boy had done his full
share of the shouting. Mrs. Eames was gratified
at the interest with which she listened,
but disappointed when she showed little or no
surprise at what had happened.
</p>

<p>
While Mrs. Eames, having more or less exhausted
her subject and herself, was drinking
the tea which Gladys made for her, the "auntie"
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_85' name='Page_85'>[85]</a></span>
told a story of her own which helped to explain
the amazing attitude of the villagers towards
the pageant. Mrs. Eames was so much interested
that she actually listened to what was
said to her, a thing she very rarely did.
</p>

<p>
According to the "auntie," the village people
had been at first just as strongly opposed to the
pageant as to any of the plays. But James
Hinton had talked long to several of the leading
men, to Jack Bunce, his fellow churchwarden,
to the elder Whitty and others. No one knew
exactly what he said, for the conversations were
held in private in Hinton's own sitting-room at
hours when the bar was not open to the public.
The result, whatever was said, was surprising.
One after another the leading men of the village
declared themselves in favour of the pageant.
They told their sons and daughters and other
dependents to do exactly what Mrs. Eames
bade them, exactly as they were bidden and
promptly. If there was any disobedience the
consequences would be serious and unpleasant.
</p>

<p>
"But," said the "auntie," "young men
aren't what they were when I was a girl. Nor
the girls aren't either." Here she scowled at
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_86' name='Page_86'>[86]</a></span>
Gladys. "And as likely as not the thing they're
bidden to do is just what they won't do though
they would have if they hadn't been bidden."
</p>

<p>
Fortunately there was another influence
which could be and was brought to bear on the
young men. James Hinton was admittedly
the richest man in the village and wealth is
power everywhere in the world. When he
came to Hailey Compton and took over the
inn from the executor of the previous owner,
he had re-painted, re-decorated, and largely
re-built the house. He had, moreover, paid cash
without hesitation or grumbling for everything
that was done. Never in living memory had
so much money been spent in the village on
building and furnishing. It therefore seemed
possible, and indeed likely, that Hinton might
spend more money and that made everyone
anxious to be on good terms with him. He was
also, from the point of view of the village men,
a model landlord for their only inn. The beer
and cider which he sold were good, of a much
better quality than they had been before he
came. He was willing to extend credit to those
who, though thirsty, had no ready money.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_87' name='Page_87'>[87]</a></span>
He seldom pressed for the payment of accounts,
even when they were large and long overdue.
He was willing to accept mortgages on cottages
and gardens, even mortgages on future catches
of fish, as satisfactory discharges of debts.
</p>

<p>
A man to whom half the community owes
money, to whom the other half expects to owe
money very soon, is in a strong position. If he
chooses to support any cause there will be
little opposition. When James Hinton, having
persuaded the older men that the pageant was
desirable, said the same thing without explanation
to the young men and maidens, all real
opposition vanished.
</p>

<p>
This was the "auntie's" account of what had
happened. Mrs. Eames accepted it as an explanation
of everything except James Hinton's
attitude. That remained a mystery.
</p>

<p>
It was true, as the "auntie," a shrewd woman,
suggested, that James Hinton might make a
good deal of money out of the pageant, if it
were a success.
</p>

<p>
"If there were a lot of people came to Hailey
Compton in them there charabancs&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"And there will be," said Mrs. Eames eagerly.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_88' name='Page_88'>[88]</a></span>
"Hundreds of people will come. Thousands.
And they'll all have to go to the Anchor Inn
for lunch and tea. There's nowhere else they
can go."
</p>

<p>
"And James Hinton can charge what he
pleases," said the "auntie."
</p>

<p>
"I see that," said Mrs. Eames. "He'll
make money out of it. That's it."
</p>

<p>
To anyone with Mrs. Eames's faith in the
ultimate success of the pageant, the explanation
should have been completely satisfying.
James Hinton had promised what he would
never be called upon to pay, with the certainty
that his promise secured him the opportunity
of earning large sums. To anyone less enthusiastic
than Mrs. Eames, Hinton's guarantee
would have looked like a desperate speculation.
If the pageant cost a good deal, as it would, and
then failed to attract a large audience, he would
have to pay and would stand no chance of
recouping himself. Even to Mrs. Eames this
view of Hinton's action presented itself all the
more clearly because she knew the man and
was firmly convinced that he would never allow
himself to be swayed by altruism. His
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_89' name='Page_89'>[89]</a></span>
guarantee, in spite of the explanation offered,
remained a puzzle.
</p>

<p>
"It's time," said the "auntie," "for me to
be getting home along."
</p>

<p>
She had drunk her share of the tea. She
had heard all that Mrs. Eames had to say,
thereby providing herself with a store of
authentic gossip which would make her an
important person in the village next day.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Eames chased the unwilling Gladys to
bed, having very little hope that the girl would
be up in time to light the kitchen fire next
morning. Girls, especially girls with Gladys's
disposition, are exceedingly sleepy at six
o'clock in the morning if they have sat up till
nearly midnight the night before.
</p>

<p>
Then Mrs. Eames went to bed herself and
slept soundly, untroubled by the problem of
James Hinton's support of the pageant. She
had long learnt the folly of worrying over the
"whys" of things, especially satisfactory things.
James Hinton had done what she herself could
never have done nearly so well. He had persuaded
the whole village to take up the smuggling
pageant with enthusiasm. That was a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_90' name='Page_90'>[90]</a></span>
fact of the most agreeable kind. Why poke
into the reasons of it? James Hinton had
promised fifty pounds, and, an almost more
astonishing thing, had induced the village
people to promise one pound two and sixpence.
These also were facts. With them, as a sensible
woman, she was more than content. It would,
indeed, have been nice to know just why James
Hinton had offered his money and how he expected
to make anything substantial out of
the business. But the problem was not one
which could keep Mrs. Eames awake.
</p>

<h2>Chapter VII</h2>

<p>
The next day was a busy one for Mrs. Eames.
</p>

<p>
It began with a demand from Gladys for a
whole holiday. Her plea was that it was
absolutely necessary for her to consult with
her "auntie" on matters of grave family importance.
She had spent a whole day the week
before and two half-days in the course of a fortnight
in the same way; and the "auntie"
had been in the vicarage kitchen for several
hours on all the other days. As an excuse for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_91' name='Page_91'>[91]</a></span>
asking for another holiday the family consultation
would not have impressed the simplest
and most inexperienced mistress, and Mrs.
Eames was no fool. She understood exactly
what Gladys wanted her holiday for.
</p>

<p>
The whole village was seething with mild
excitement over the meeting of the night before.
Gossip of the most fascinating kind was flying
from lip to ear at every cottage door. The most
wild and improbable tales were being listened
to with perfect belief. No girl would like to
be shut up by herself in a kitchen while such
joys were to be found outside. And Gladys,
with her intimate knowledge of all that happened
in the vicarage, would be welcome anywhere.
She would be in a position to command the
attention of thrilled audiences whatever she
chose to say.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Eames thoroughly understood this.
Being a kind-hearted woman, full of sympathy
with anyone who enjoyed excitement, she gave
Gladys a holiday without a murmur.
</p>

<p>
This was not so difficult for her as it would
have been for many mistresses. The vicar
went off soon after breakfast with a package of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_92' name='Page_92'>[92]</a></span>
sandwiches in his pocket. There was therefore
no cooking to be done for him. Mrs. Eames
never cooked for herself when left alone. She
did not even lay a table for herself or go to the
trouble of getting out plates, knives or forks.
Her plan, a very sensible one, was to eat whatever
she could find whenever she felt hungry,
generally without even sitting down. When
Gladys walked off in a white skirt and a pink
silk jumper, Mrs. Eames had to make the beds
and wash up the breakfast things. Otherwise
the want of a servant left her with little or no
extra work.
</p>

<p>
She was washing up cups and plates when she
caught sight through the pantry window of
James Hinton. Many vicars' wives, obliged
to keep up the difficult pretence that they live
as ladies, would have been embarrassed at
being discovered in an apron, with sleeves
rolled up, over a pantry sink, by a visitor like
Hinton. But Mrs. Eames was entirely free
from any taint of snobbishness. She would
have gone on ironing clothes in front of her
drawing-room fire if a duchess had called on
her while so occupied. She greeted Hinton
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_93' name='Page_93'>[93]</a></span>
through the window and invited him to walk
straight into the pantry.
</p>

<p>
Hinton's manners were as good as hers.
Instead of expressing surprise or contempt,
instead of offering any kind of excuse or apology
for Mrs. Eames's occupation, he took his place
beside the sink, picked up a glass-cloth and
dried the vessels which Mrs. Eames handed to
him. He did not even allow it to appear by a
glance or a sniff that he found the cloth he
used disgustingly dirty, though it was, being
one of those of which Gladys had charge. It
was not in vain that Hinton had lived as footman
and valet in some of the best houses in
England. He had acquired the manners of a
great gentleman.
</p>

<p>
While they worked together, Hinton explained
the objects of his visit. It was, in
his opinion, desirable to secure as many
influential patrons as possible for the pageant.
</p>

<p>
"Of course," said Mrs. Eames, "we've
got to advertise, and there are only two ways
of doing that. Either we've got to spend a
lot of money, which we haven't got&mdash;though
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_94' name='Page_94'>[94]</a></span>
your guarantee was extremely generous. It
quite took my breath away."
</p>

<p>
"A trifle, madam," said Hinton, drying a
plate carefully, "a mere trifle."
</p>

<p>
"It wasn't a trifle at all," said Mrs. Eames,
"but it won't run to a whole page advertisement
in a daily paper. Luckily there's another
way of advertising. My niece, Miss Appleby,
told me about it. You know her, don't
you?"
</p>

<p>
Hinton had never met Beth Appleby, but was
quite prepared to listen to her views about
advertising.
</p>

<p>
"The thing to do," said Mrs. Eames, brandishing
a dripping cloth, "is to get names that
advertise themselves."
</p>

<p>
Hinton took the fork from her gently and
wiped it with Gladys's dirty cloth.
</p>

<p>
"Quite so, madam."
</p>

<p>
"If you get the proper names," said Mrs.
Eames, "the newspapers will put in paragraphs
about them without being paid. That's what
my niece says."
</p>

<p>
"Having lived in many of the best houses in
England," said Hinton, "I may say that I am
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_95' name='Page_95'>[95]</a></span>
aware of the advertisement value of our aristocracy."
</p>

<p>
"It's not only the aristocracy. Politicians
are just as good. Actresses are probably better.
Even authors&mdash;there are one or two authors&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I thought, madam," said Hinton, "that we
might begin by securing the name of the bishop
of the diocese."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Eames sniffed. The bishop was a man
of unblemished integrity, of kindly disposition,
of respectable scholarship, but he did not strike
her as having what Hinton described as "advertisement
value." He had never denied the
truth of any article in the Apostles' Creed. He
did not preach in Methodist Chapels, or if he did
made no public boast about it. He had never
prosecuted any of his clergy for excessive devotion
to catholicism. These are the only ways
in which an ecclesiastic can attract public attention
to himself, that is to say the only ways of
acquiring "advertisement value."
</p>

<p>
"I don't see," said Mrs. Eames, "that the
bishop would be much good to us."
</p>

<p>
Hinton bowed a submissive acquiescence in
her opinion.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_96' name='Page_96'>[96]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"I'm sure you know best, madam."
</p>

<p>
"My idea," said Mrs. Eames, "would be to
start with Sir Evelyn Dent. He has promised
to support us and I'm sure he'll have no objection
to the use of his name as a patron. An ex-Cabinet
Minister with a title! Don't forget the
title, Hinton. And he has an honourable all of
his own besides the knighthood."
</p>

<p>
"Sir Evelyn," said Hinton, "might perhaps
secure the support of the present earl."
</p>

<p>
"Present earl? Oh, of course, his nephew,
Lord Colavon. Yes. He would be quite good.
An earl is an earl of course, but except for being
an earl he's nothing particular, is he? I mean
to say he's not well known."
</p>

<p>
"Not in political or literary circles, madam.
The tastes of the present earl are understood to
be sporting and dramatic."
</p>

<p>
"Dramatic!" Mrs. Eames became suddenly
interested.
</p>

<p>
Hinton was drying the last saucer. Mrs.
Eames, the task of washing up finished, was
rubbing her dripping hands on her apron.
</p>

<p>
"Scarcely dramatic in the higher sense of the
word," said Hinton. "The tastes of the present
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_97' name='Page_97'>[97]</a></span>
earl are rather in the direction of comic
opera."
</p>

<p>
"He won't do us any harm, I suppose," said
Mrs. Eames, "and I dare say Sir Evelyn will get
him for us. Now who else would you suggest?"
</p>

<p>
"Did I mention the bishop, madam?"
</p>

<p>
"You did. And I said I didn't see what use
the bishop would be. In fact he'd be worse
than no use. If the public sees the name of a
bishop at the head of a list of patrons it naturally
thinks that the show is going to be a
Diocesan Conference or something of the sort
and simply stays away."
</p>

<p>
Again Hinton gave way, or appeared to give
way.
</p>

<p>
"It might be advantageous, madam," he
said, "if we secured the name of some gentleman
prominently connected with the customs
and excise."
</p>

<p>
Hinton's ideas of suitable patrons were certainly
odd. A custom house officer, though a
useful and generally an active civil servant, is
not the sort of man whose name often appears
in the newspapers.
</p>

<p>
"The name of a custom house officer on our
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_98' name='Page_98'>[98]</a></span>
list of patrons," Hinton explained, "would
convince the public that our pageant is entirely
<i>bona fide</i>."
</p>

<p>
"But what else could it be? You don't mean
to suggest that we should really smuggle
things?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course not, madam, but the public is
sometimes very unintelligent, and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"No public could possibly be as stupid as
that."
</p>

<p>
The cups and plates were by this time restored
to their shelves in the pantry. Hinton,
having discovered a leather, was giving an unaccustomed
polish to the spoons and forks.
</p>

<p>
"I only suggested a customs officer," he
said, "because I thought that if he became interested
he might arrange for some of his subordinates
to take part in the pageant, as preventive
officers, capturing the smugglers and
the lugger. That's simply an idea. Of course
the management of the dramatic side of the
pageant is entirely in your hands."
</p>

<p>
"It's a jolly good idea. Real coastguards&mdash;but
of course there aren't any now. Real preventive
officers riding down the hill just in time
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_99' name='Page_99'>[99]</a></span>
to&mdash;&mdash; Or coming in a revenue cutter and firing
on the lugger. I wonder if we could get them.
Oh, do stop polishing those spoons, Hinton. It
fidgets me to see you. Come into the vicar's
study and talk over this idea of yours."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps," said Hinton as they left the
room, "there are some other household duties
of which I could relieve you. I think you
may safely trust me. I have had considerable
experience in some of the best houses in
England."
</p>

<p>
"If you like to help me to make the vicar's
bed," said Mrs. Eames, "I don't mind."
</p>

<p>
"I shall be most happy," said Hinton, "but
I beg of you, madam, to leave it entirely to me.
If you will await me in the study&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He held the door open for her and when he
had shown her into the room went upstairs.
But Mrs. Eames was not a lady who could sit
still for very long, especially with an exciting
idea in her mind. The thought of securing real
customs officers thrilled her. After wandering
about the room for some minutes she followed
Hinton upstairs. She found him brushing an
old and dilapidated pair of the vicar's trousers.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_100' name='Page_100'>[100]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Do you happen to know any customs
officers?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
Hinton folded the trousers with careful
exactness and put them in a drawer.
</p>

<p>
"Not personally, madam. But no doubt I
can find out who the local head of that service
is."
</p>

<p>
"Then do," said Mrs. Eames. "I'll leave
that in your hands."
</p>

<p>
"And the bishop?" said Hinton. "Perhaps
it would be better if you or the vicar were
to approach the bishop."
</p>

<p>
Hinton was stropping the vicar's razor with
vigour and skill.
</p>

<p>
"How you do nag on about the bishop!"
said Mrs. Eames. "Please leave that razor
alone. The vicar cuts himself often enough as
it is and if you go making it too sharp he may
give himself a dangerous gash. Why on earth
are you so keen on the bishop? I've no objection
to bishops of course, and if there's any real
reason&mdash;&mdash; It's no use expecting him to read the
funeral service over a smuggler shot by a coastguard.
I quite see that would be most effective
but no bishop would do it."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_101' name='Page_101'>[101]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"The idea in my mind&mdash;&mdash;" said Hinton, who
was arranging the vicar's toothbrush and sponge
neatly on the washing stand.
</p>

<p>
He went on to give his reasons for wishing to
secure the bishop as a patron.
</p>

<p>
Bishops, so he explained, inspire great confidence
in the public, which is always a little
afraid of being let in for something improper or
a little dubious.
</p>

<p>
"If we were concerned only with the aristocracy,
madam, it would be a different matter.
If I may say so, speaking after many years' experience
of the upper classes, there would be no
objection whatever to a hint, a suggestion of the
risqué."
</p>

<p>
"But, good gracious, Hinton, we're not going
to do anything in the least risqué as you call
it."
</p>

<p>
"Certainly not, madam. Most assuredly not.
But the public&mdash;the general public apart from
the aristocracy and outside of literary and
artistic circles&mdash;the public which we wish to
attract, is very suspicious."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Eames did not believe that any public
could possibly suspect her pageant of being
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_102' name='Page_102'>[102]</a></span>
improper. But Hinton insisted that he was right
and that their only security lay in having at
least one bishop among their patrons.
</p>

<p>
"Very well," she said at last, "I'll leave the
list of patrons entirely to you, Hinton. Get
that sporting earl of yours if you can. Get a
few of his musical comedy actresses too. Get
a bishop and a couple of custom house officers.
Get the local police if you like."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, madam. Will you approach the
bishop or shall I see the vicar about it?"
</p>

<p>
"You'd better do it yourself. As a churchwarden
you've a perfect right to tackle a bishop.
And anyway I'm sure the vicar won't, though
he ought to after the way you've folded his
trousers for him and stropped his razor. All I
ask is that if you have a committee meeting of
your patrons&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"There will not, I imagine, madam, be any
necessity for that."
</p>

<p>
"Well, if there is," said Mrs. Eames, "you
may take the chair at it yourself, for I won't."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_103' name='Page_103'>[103]</a></span>
</p>

<h2>Chapter VIII</h2>

<p>
Although Battersea is far from being a fashionable
part of London there are pleasant little
flats to be had there, overlooking the park, for
those who are indifferent to the advantages of
a smart address.
</p>

<p>
One of these is shared by Beth Appleby and
her friend Mary Lambert. Beth Appleby makes
an unsatisfying income by casual journalism,
relying chiefly on the small but regular payments
made by a syndicating agency for a
weekly letter on London life. This is widely
circulated in provincial papers. Miss Lambert
dances fairly well and sings badly. She obtains
engagements of uncertain duration in revues
and musical comedies. There are times when
she envies the steady weekly income paid to her
friend by the syndicators. There are other
times when Beth Appleby thinks that dancing
is a better way of earning a living than writing.
Pens may be mightier than swords, but legs are
often more profitable than either.
</p>

<p>
The two girls were together in their flat one
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_104' name='Page_104'>[104]</a></span>
sunny morning at the end of May, just such a
morning as makes young people long for pleasure
and makes work of every kind extremely irksome,
and, for most of us&mdash;though the thing
seems self-contradictory&mdash;the want of work
more irksome still.
</p>

<p>
Beth was at her writing-table, her pen in her
hand, a sheet of paper in front of her. She had
written the words "Lilith lisps" and then come
to a dead stop. This was not surprising.
Lilith had already lisped four times since breakfast.
Beth lacked matter for a fifth and, like
Rosalind's orator in a similar case, felt strongly
inclined to spit.
</p>

<p>
Mary lay back in the most comfortable chair
in the room with her feet on another. She had
a cigarette between her fingers which she put to
her lips occasionally but without much satisfaction.
She was meditating disconsolately on
the failure of the last show in which she had
danced, a disaster which brought her face to
face with the difficult task of getting another
engagement.
</p>

<p>
"I wonder," said Beth irritably, "if there's
anything in the world left for Lilith to lisp about."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_105' name='Page_105'>[105]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"There's me," said Mary. "'Lilith lisps that
Miss Lambert, the charming young danseuse
who has won the hearts of London playgoers, is
thinking of accepting a tempting offer to go to
New York.'"
</p>

<p>
"I'd do that and more for you, Mary, dear,"
said Beth, "if I thought it would be the slightest
use. But it wouldn't. Lilith's delightful lispings
aren't read by anybody except the wives
and daughters of greengrocers in Muddleborough
and such places."
</p>

<p>
"A provincial engagement would be better
than nothing."
</p>

<p>
"Besides," said Beth, "Lilith can't be
always lisping about you. It's only a fortnight
ago that I had you 'robed in a novel and daring
creation' at a garden party given by Jimmy.
He was rather stuffy about it afterwards. He
said that if any of his aunts had seen the paragraph
they'd have been down on him for not
asking them to the party. I rather think he
was afraid that if I wrote anything more of the
kind he might be forced to give a garden party."
</p>

<p>
Jimmy&mdash;spoken of in this familiar way by
both girls&mdash;is the Earl of Colavon, of whom
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_106' name='Page_106'>[106]</a></span>
James Hinton said that his tastes were sporting
and dramatic.
</p>

<p>
"Let's invent another new frock," said Mary.
"Next to having one, which I can't, the most
amusing thing would be to imagine what it would
be like if I could. I'll give you the details. All
you have to do is to say that you saw me in it at
a reception in Lambeth Palace, given by the
Bishop of London."
</p>

<p>
"It's the Archbishop of Canterbury who lives
at Lambeth."
</p>

<p>
"All the better. It sounds far grander for
poor little me and less likely to be contradicted.
An archbishop can't possibly know who wears
what at his receptions. And, anyhow, he'll
never read anything you write, Beth, darling."
</p>

<p>
"I'll tell you what I'll do for you if you like,"
said Beth. "I'll make Lilith lisp that you're one
of the patrons of Aunt Agatha's pageant. She's
got a bishop, so you really might be asked to a
reception in a palace. And she's got Sir Evelyn
Dent. What she wants now are a few literary
and artistic stars to brighten things up a bit."
</p>

<p>
"I'll do that all right for her, if she'll give me
a decent contract and pay for rehearsals."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_107' name='Page_107'>[107]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"I don't fancy Aunt Agatha can pay anybody
for anything."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'm not going into it for the love of
art; but if you can put my name down as a
patron it might be some use. Almost any kind
of ad. pays, and it isn't every day I get the
chance of appearing in print alongside of a
bishop and a Prime Minister. Sir Evelyn Dent
is Jimmy's uncle, isn't he? And he used to be
Prime Minister."
</p>

<p>
"Not quite," said Beth, "but as near as
doesn't matter."
</p>

<p>
"What's the thing about? English history,
I suppose. If it's Fair Rosamund we might
work in a dance. I could do something graceful
in a long skirt which wouldn't shock the bishop,
holding the cup of poison in my hand. Your
aunt could be Queen Eleanor if she liked. I'd
do it for ten pounds and exes."
</p>

<p>
"Nothing doing in that way, I'm afraid," said
Beth. "It's about smugglers."
</p>

<p>
"Well, there's that Nautch Girl dance of
mine. It's not bad at all. And if your aunt
can't pay I dare say Jimmy could screw a tenner
out of that uncle of his. It would be quite
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_108' name='Page_108'>[108]</a></span>
worth it to the show. No feeling of stuffiness
about that dance. I should think that pirates&mdash;you
said pirates, didn't you?"
</p>

<p>
"Smugglers."
</p>

<p>
"Much the same thing. Smugglers or
pirates are sure to be mixed up with nautch
girls, whatever they are. Or at all events
girls of some kind. I don't mind calling it
a geisha dance if they like. I could borrow a
kimono."
</p>

<p>
"'Lilith lisps,'" said Beth, taking her pen
again, "'that among the patrons of the Hailey
Compton Smuggling Pageant is Miss Mary
Lambert, whose Nautch Girl dance has just
delighted London. The wide appeal made by
this pageant&mdash;the most magnificently staged
show ever produced in England&mdash;will be understood
when it is realised that among those
interested, besides Miss Mary Lambert, are Sir
Evelyn Dent, the Bishop of ...' remind me
afterwards to find out what he's bishop of.
'And....' Now did Aunt Agatha mention
anyone else? I can't remember. Anyhow, we'll
put in Jimmy. He won't mind. 'The Earl
of Colavon, whose name stands <i>facile princeps</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_109' name='Page_109'>[109]</a></span>
among our sporting peers of the younger generation.'
Thank heaven, there's another lisp.
That makes five. If I'd three more I'd be
through with the beastly things for this week,
and I'd take you out on top of a bus to Kew
or somewhere to get a breath of fresh air."
</p>

<p>
Fortune was kind to Beth Appleby. While
she was still biting the end of her pen Lord
Colavon came into the room. He brought with
him an air of breezy cheerfulness, very like
the weather outside, and a gaiety natural enough
in one who was not compelled to write weekly
"lispings" for his daily bread and ran no risk
of losing his income through the failure of an
apathetic public to appreciate a Nautch Girl
dance.
</p>

<p>
"Jimmy," said Beth, "help me out."
</p>

<p>
"The precise thing I've come to do," said
Jimmy. "New 8-cylinder Pallas Athene,
sports model, guaranteed 70 miles an hour
on the road, did over 100 at Brooklands, stands
panting at the door. Dine at Oxford. Dine at
York. Dine anywhere you like. Home by
moonlight. Is there a moon? Must be a
moon in May. 'The young May moon is
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_110' name='Page_110'>[110]</a></span>
beaming, love.' The poet wouldn't have said
that if there wasn't a moon in May. Dashed
particular about facts, poets have to be."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Jimmy," said Mary. "Just wait one
minute till we get on our hats. Come, Beth."
</p>

<p>
But Beth Appleby had a conscience, or that
fairly satisfactory substitute for a conscience, a
sense of prudence. Lilith's Lispings had to
be posted that night, or there would be no
cheque at the end of the week. And Lilith
had only achieved six poor lisps.
</p>

<p>
"Can't be done," she said, "simply can't.
Unless you can help me out with Lilith,
Jimmy."
</p>

<p>
Lord Colavon's tastes were sporting and
dramatic, but he was not altogether ignorant of
our current literature. Thanks to an intimacy
of some years with Beth Appleby, he knew all
about Lilith's lispings and had often suggested
valuable ideas. He did not fail now.
</p>

<p>
"What about the Pallas Athene?" he said.
"Absolutely the latest thing. Triumph of
British engineering. Revelation of speed possibility
of road travel. See company's catalogue,
free on application."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_111' name='Page_111'>[111]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"'Lilith lisps,'" Beth wrote rapidly, "'that
the <i>dernier cri</i> in motor luxury is the&mdash;&mdash;' what
did you call it, Jimmy?"
</p>

<p>
"Pallas Athene. Sports model."
</p>

<p>
Beth wrote down Pallas Athene and then
went on:
</p>

<p>
"'The upholstery is of delicately tinted
Russia leather, equally suited to the light fabric
of a summer frock and the rich glow of winter
furs.'"
</p>

<p>
"Hold on," said Jimmy. "There's no use
misleading the good old public. It's an 8-cylinder
sports model, not a bus for going out
to dinner in at night."
</p>

<p>
"What I've got to do," said Beth, "is to
write something that'll thrill my readers.
Lilith doesn't get into motor garages, and isn't
read by mechanics. She lisps in the chaste
parlours of the ladies of the provincial middle
classes. What they like to hear about is the
upholstery. They don't care a rap about
cylinders."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, well, say what you jolly well like about
the car, but it will be awkward for me if one of
my aunts, or good old Uncle Evie, who might
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_112' name='Page_112'>[112]</a></span>
almost as well be an aunt, went and bought the
car expecting it to be the sort of gentle family
pet which purrs when stroked."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose," said Beth, writing fast, "that
you will have no objection to my saying that
you were seen getting out of the car outside a
club in St. James's?"
</p>

<p>
"None in the world," said Jimmy. "You
can say any mortal thing you like about me,
Beth, so long as you get through with that
beastly writing of yours and come out for a spin."
</p>

<p>
"I've got you down already, along with Mary
and Sir Evelyn and some bishop or other, as a
patron of Aunt Agatha's pageant."
</p>

<p>
"I say, is that the thing Uncle Evie is so
keen on? I'd a letter from him the other day,
asking me if I knew of a lugger which could be
hired by the week or bought cheap."
</p>

<p>
"Good," said Beth. "I'll make a paragraph
about that. 'Apropos of the Hailey
Compton Pageant, Lilith lisps that the harbours
of England are being searched for a genuine
eighteenth century lugger. Lord Colavon, who,
besides being a keen motorist, is a distinguished
yachtsman&mdash;&mdash;'"
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_113' name='Page_113'>[113]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"But, I say, what's the old pageant about?
That's what I want to know, and being a patron
I think I've a right to ask."
</p>

<p>
"Smuggling," said Beth. "But for goodness'
sake don't interrupt. If I'm to get these
lispings done at all I simply must stick at
it."
</p>

<p>
"I don't believe Uncle Evie is going to
smuggle. He's not sportsman enough."
</p>

<p>
Mary Lambert, fully dressed for the motor
run, slipped into the room in time to hear
Jimmy's defence of his uncle's character.
</p>

<p>
"If he won't," she said, "I wish somebody
else would. The price of silk stockings is
scandalous, and unless something is done about
it poor girls like me won't be able to live at all.
It seems to me, Jimmy, that it's your plain duty
to do a little smuggling in the interests of the
profession. Other people may be able to get
on without silk. We can't. It's a business
necessity."
</p>

<p>
Jimmy sat silent for a minute or two, meditating
on Mary's proposal. Then he suddenly
addressed Beth.
</p>

<p>
"Nearly finished? For if you're not too
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_114' name='Page_114'>[114]</a></span>
breathless to listen I've got a scheme to
propose."
</p>

<p>
"Give me one more lisp," said Beth, "and
I'm yours for a thousand miles in the Russia
leather Pallas Athene, all meals <i>en route</i> provided
free."
</p>

<p>
"What I was just going to suggest," said
Jimmy, "is that we should run down and dine
with Uncle Evie, just to find out about this
smuggling stunt of his."
</p>

<p>
"I should be terrified out of my life," said
Mary. "I'm not accustomed to Cabinet
Ministers, or for the matter of that to titled
aristocrats, except you, Jimmy, and nobody
would ever take you for an earl."
</p>

<p>
"You needn't be the least bit nervous," said
Jimmy. "Uncle Evie is a bit boring at times,
but he wouldn't frighten a ten-year-old orphan.
We'll send him a wire to say we're coming."
</p>

<p>
"Jimmy," said Beth, "you're priceless!
That's another lisp. Absolutely a topper. 'I
had the good fortune to be present a few evenings
ago at an informal little <i>al fresco</i> dinner
given by Sir Evelyn Dent in his fascinating
thirteenth century moated grange&mdash;&mdash;'"
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_115' name='Page_115'>[115]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"There's no moat," said Jimmy, "and it's
a Manor House."
</p>

<p>
"What does that matter?" said Beth. "It's
old, I suppose. People like your uncle always
live in old houses."
</p>

<p>
"It's old, all right," said Jimmy.
</p>

<p>
"Then moated grange is the proper thing to
call it when writing the Lispings of Lilith, but
if you really prefer it I don't mind calling it an
historic pile. 'Sir Evelyn, a dignified and
gracious&mdash;&mdash;' What's the masculine of 'châtelaine,'
Jimmy?"
</p>

<p>
"'Château,' I should think," said Jimmy,
"but don't call poor old Uncle Evie that. He'd
hate it."
</p>

<p>
"'Sir Evelyn,'" said Beth, writing as she
spoke, "'who between ourselves&mdash;&mdash;' I mean
to say '<i>entre nous</i> is something of a <i>grand
seigneur</i>.'"
</p>

<p>
"I know I'll be petrified with terror," said
Mary. "A <i>grand seigneur</i> in a moated grange."
</p>

<p>
"'Among the guests,'" Beth went on, "'was
the Earl of Colavon, who was wearing the
famous diamond studs which have been in the
family since Henry VIII gave them to Anne
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_116' name='Page_116'>[116]</a></span>
Boleyn, who was, as everybody knows, one of
the ancestors of the Dents,'"
</p>

<p>
"Hang it all, Beth," said Jimmy, "I don't
mind your making a fool of me in any ordinary
way, but a fellow must draw the line somewhere.
Why can't you say that Uncle Evie
wore the diamond studs?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm putting him down for the Garter Ribbon,"
said Beth, "so you must have the diamond
studs. Though I don't mind making
them pearl if you'd rather. You simply must
give the public what it wants if you go in for
literature at all."
</p>

<p>
"Well, hurry up," said Jimmy. "It's all of
180 miles down to Uncle Evie's moated grange
and I shall have to push the sports model along a
bit if we're to get there for the <i>al fresco</i> dinner."
</p>

<p>
"Five minutes more and I've finished," said
Beth. "'The conversation after dinner turned
on&mdash;&mdash; Now what do you think, belovedest?
Politics? Wrong. Science? Wrong. Guess
again. Well, if you won't, let us whisper:
silk stockings. But you'd have guessed that,
wouldn't you? if I'd mentioned that Miss
Mary Lambert was one of the party.'"
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_117' name='Page_117'>[117]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"I won't have it," said Mary. "As if I'd
dare to talk about silk stockings to a <i>grand
seigneur</i>. Tell her not to, Jimmy."
</p>

<p>
"Not much use my telling Beth anything.
Besides, we are going to talk about silk stockings,
aren't we? I mean to say, that's the general
idea of the party&mdash;smuggling and so forth."
</p>

<p>
"Thank Heaven, I've finished," said Beth.
"I'll just run and change my frock, and then
we'll see what the Pallas Athene can do along
the roads."
</p>

<p>
"If anybody talks about silk stockings,"
said Mary when Beth had left the room, "it'll
have to be you, Jimmy. I simply daren't to a
man like your uncle."
</p>

<p>
"But that's what we're going to see Uncle
Evie about. What I mean to say is this: we
want to get all the particulars about this smuggling
stunt of his, whether there's any chance of
fitting in a little of the real thing. It all depends,
you know. But if we could manage to
get in a few dozen pairs of silk stockings under
cover of the pageant it'd be all to the good for
you and Beth, wouldn't it?"
</p>

<p>
"Jimmy," said Mary, "you're an angel!"
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_118' name='Page_118'>[118]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"I don't promise anything. It all depends on
how Uncle Evie's working the thing. If he
leaves the lugger part of the show in my hands&mdash;&mdash;
Didn't Beth say there was a bishop in it?
You can do pretty nearly anything if you're
holding hands with a bishop. Nobody ever
suspects you. Besides, he might be a sportsman
himself&mdash;the bishop, I mean. Some are,
I'm told. Anyhow, I don't suppose he'd have
any objection to a case of champagne. If he
didn't care to drink it himself he could give it
away to poor parsons in the diocese."
</p>

<h2>Chapter IX</h2>

<p>
For the first hundred and thirty miles or so of
the journey the Pallas Athene did all that could
be expected of an eight-cylinder sports model
driven by a young man who did not shrink
from paying an occasional fine. The needle
of the speedometer often flickered past the
sixty miles mark. The average speed fell
little short of double that which our legislators&mdash;the
same people who made the laws about
beer&mdash;consider sufficient. Ilchester was reached
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_119' name='Page_119'>[119]</a></span>
in less than four hours. Jimmy, slowing down
slightly through the long narrow street of the
village, congratulated himself and his passengers
on the achievement.
</p>

<p>
"I call that a satisfactory record so far,"
he said, "and we haven't killed or maimed so
much as a dog, which just shows the advantage
of careful driving."
</p>

<p>
He congratulated himself too soon. The
inhabitants of Ilchester, indeed, escaped with
their lives. Three main roads unite to run
through their village, so they have learnt to
be exceedingly alert and active. Lord Colavon
had not so much as a broken collar-bone on his
conscience when he pressed his foot on the
accelerator at the end of the village. But a
few miles along the road the engine began to
give trouble. Jimmy was perfectly sure that
he knew what was the matter with it. He
spent ten minutes in oily work with a spanner.
After that, things became rapidly worse.
Noises of the most terrifying kind became
frequent, and it was no longer possible to
persuade the Pallas Athene to do more than
thirty miles an hour on a level stretch of road.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_120' name='Page_120'>[120]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Jimmy, less confident than he had been that
he knew what was the matter, left his direct
road and went to Taunton. There he sought
help in a garage while the two girls had tea.
The mechanic, an intelligent and competent
man, shook his head over the Pallas Athene.
He preferred a soberer and more reliable kind
of car, even if it could not be driven very fast.
In his opinion it would be folly to go on any
farther, and he spoke vaguely of telegraphing
to the makers of the car for some spare
parts.
</p>

<p>
"Spare parts be damned," said Jimmy.
"That means waiting here for the best part
of a week."
</p>

<p>
The mechanic could not deny that the getting
of spare parts is often a tedious business,
especially&mdash;here he glanced with dislike at the
Pallas Athene&mdash;"from the makers of cars like
that."
</p>

<p>
"Can't you patch her up somehow," said
Jimmy, "so that I can push on another forty
or fifty miles? I haven't much more than
that to do."
</p>

<p>
"I can patch her up," said the mechanic,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_121' name='Page_121'>[121]</a></span>
"but there's no man living can tell how far she'll
run afterwards."
</p>

<p>
Being a cautious man, experienced in the
ways of motor-cars, he refused, even when
pressed, to give any exact estimate of the distance
which the patched Pallas Athene might
run. The only thing he regarded as certain
was that she would break down completely in
the end.
</p>

<p>
"It might be two miles out of the town," he
said, "or it might be a hundred."
</p>

<p>
"Do the best you can with her while I'm
getting a cup of tea," said Jimmy. "Then fill
up her tank and give her a pint of oil. I'll risk
it."
</p>

<p>
The behaviour of the Pallas Athene after
leaving Taunton was excellent. It may have
been that the hour's rest in the garage revived
her. More probably she was pleased by the
attention she received from the mechanic. All
women, even dignified Greek goddesses, like
being fussed over and petted. Jimmy was
moderate in his demands for speed and did not
demand anything more than what he called "a
funeral trot" of thirty-five miles an hour.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_122' name='Page_122'>[122]</a></span>
Exeter was passed successfully, and the time
came when the main road must be left for the
last stage of the journey.
</p>

<p>
Jimmy, gaining confidence, ran at a fair
speed up and down some abrupt hills on roads
marked on the maps in inferior colours, occasionally
not coloured at all. On a lonely open
stretch of one of what the map makers describe
as "other metalled roads, narrow," the breakdown,
prophesied by the Taunton mechanic,
came. Without so much as a warning shriek or
a death rattle the Pallas Athene gasped and
stopped.
</p>

<p>
Jimmy did all that a man could do. He lay
on his back and screwed nuts. He lay on his side
and screwed other nuts. He crawled on his
stomach. He knelt, stooped, crouched, tapped
and hammered. Like the good Samaritan, he
poured in oil and would have poured in wine too
if he had had any. Beth and Mary encouraged
him and tried to help him. They spread a
whole kit of tools out on a bank on the side of
the road and very soon learned to distinguish
between a double-ended spanner, a box spanner
and an adjustable spanner, often handed the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_123' name='Page_123'>[123]</a></span>
right weapon to Jimmy without giving him a
wrong one more than a couple of times first.
</p>

<p>
"Well I'm damned if I know what's wrong,"
said Jimmy, after an hour's experimental effort.
"If only the wretched thing had held out
another quarter of an hour we'd have been
there, we can't be more than seven or eight
miles from Morriton St. James, and Uncle
Evie's house is just outside."
</p>

<p>
"Couldn't Mary and I walk on," said Beth,
"and send somebody back for you? There
must be a car in the village?"
</p>

<p>
"Morriton St. James is a town, not a village,"
said Jimmy, "and there are lots of cars, but it
would take you the best part of three hours to
get there&mdash;if you ever got there at all. Look at
Mary's shoes, and your own are no better."
</p>

<p>
Mary exhibited, for admiration or contempt,
a delicate suède shoe, certainly not intended for
long walks over rough roads.
</p>

<p>
"I'd go myself," said Jimmy, "but I hate
leaving you two alone in a place like this. I
never saw such a road in my life. Not a blessed
thing has passed, going either way since the
Pallas Athene lay down and died."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_124' name='Page_124'>[124]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"I'll do a lisp next week," said Beth, "on the
dangerously congested condition of our country
roads."
</p>

<p>
"I don't suppose anything ever does pass or
ever will," said Jimmy.
</p>

<p>
He had been too optimistic at Ilchester over
the performances of the Pallas Athene. He was
too pessimistic now about the traffic on the
road to Morriton St. James. A moving object
appeared far off. The sound of clanging metal
reached their ears. A very old Ford car came
rattling towards them at a steady, but apparently
laborious, twenty miles an hour. At the
steering wheel sat James Hinton of the Anchor
Inn in Hailey Compton.
</p>

<p>
Jimmy was determined not to be passed by.
There are a few motorists as indifferent to the
calls of charity as if they were priests or Levites,
who go their way without succouring those in
distress on the roadside. The driver of the
Ford might be such a man. Jimmy made sure
that he would at least stop by standing with
outstretched hands in the middle of the road.
The Pallas Athene, her wheels against one
bank, occupied about one third of the road,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_125' name='Page_125'>[125]</a></span>
which was not very wide. Jimmy, half-way to
the other bank, made passing impossible without
homicide. He need not have taken such extreme
measures. James Hinton pulled up and
inquired politely what was the matter and
whether he could be of any use.
</p>

<p>
"If you'll take these two ladies into Morriton
St. James," said Jimmy, "and send someone
back to tow this car I shall be greatly obliged,
and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He felt in his pocket for a coin, looking hard
at James Hinton, to discover, if possible,
whether he was the sort of man to whom a tip
should be offered. James Hinton, since he pulled
up, had been looking hard at Jimmy. In spite of
the smears of oily dust which were on his face and
his generally dishevelled appearance, he was
recognisable.
</p>

<p>
"Certainly, my lord," he said. "It will be
nothing but a pleasure to oblige your lordship in
any possible way. Would it be convenient if I
was to take the two ladies straight to the Manor
House. It occurs to me that your lordship may
intend to pay a visit to Sir Evelyn Dent, your
lordship's uncle."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_126' name='Page_126'>[126]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"I say," said Jimmy. "You seem to know
all about me, and I'm delighted to meet you
again and all that; but&mdash;damned stupid of me,
of course&mdash;I can't for the life of me recollect
who you are."
</p>

<p>
"Your lordship wouldn't recollect me," said
Hinton. "It's not to be expected that you
would; but I was in the late earl's service as
first footman, and I had the honour of valetting
your lordship sometimes lately when you stayed
with Lord Dollman without bringing your own
man."
</p>

<p>
"Got you now," said Jimmy. "You're the
fellow Dolly thought such a lot of. Said he
never knew anyone with such a talent for
spotting winners. Anyhow, Dolly used to make
pots while he had you."
</p>

<p>
"Very kind of his lordship to say so," said
Hinton. "It's always been my wish to give
satisfaction."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose you don't happen to be out of a
job now. If you cared to come to me&mdash;&mdash; What
about it?"
</p>

<p>
"Very kind of your lordship," said Hinton,
"but I've retired from gentlemen's service.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_127' name='Page_127'>[127]</a></span>
But of course if I could be of any use to your
lordship&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You can and shall," said Jimmy. "You
shall take these two ladies to the Manor House."
</p>

<p>
"Jimmy, dear," said Mary, catching his arm,
"I daren't, simply daren't face your uncle without
you. I don't believe Beth would either.
He wouldn't know who we were."
</p>

<p>
"It would be a bit awkward," said Beth. "I
don't suppose Sir Evelyn has so much as heard
our names."
</p>

<p>
She was wrong about that. Sir Evelyn had
heard her name very often since the idea of the
smuggling pageant occurred to Mrs. Eames.
He had even read, with gratification, every lisp
of Lilith's in which his name had been mentioned
since Beth began her campaign of
advertising the pageant.
</p>

<p>
James Hinton, who had left his seat and was
arranging the back part of his car for the reception
of ladies, understood the situation, or
thought he did. In fact he understood it too
well, believing it to be rather more awkward
than it actually was. It was perfectly plain to
him that the two girls did not belong to the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_128' name='Page_128'>[128]</a></span>
class which habitually visits the houses of our
higher aristocracy. Since, in spite of that, they
spoke to Lord Colavon as "Jimmy, dear," he
assumed that they belonged to another class
which could not be introduced to Jimmy's
aunts, or even to his uncle without some explanation.
</p>

<p>
"If I might be allowed to make a suggestion,
my lord," he said, "why not permit me to tow
your car into Morriton St. James and then your
lordship could accompany the ladies to the
Manor House."
</p>

<p>
Jimmy looked at the derelict Pallas Athene.
She was a long, low car, and her body sloped
back in lines rather like the rake of the masts
of a pirate schooner in a novel. Her delicate
pale blue paint still shone, though covered with
the dust of the long journey. Her aluminium
bonnet glistened in the rays of the setting sun.
Her great balloon tyres lay like coiled monsters
under her wide black wings. He looked at
Hinton's Ford, squat, dumpy, perched absurdly
above her little wheels. He noted the battered
mud guards, the chipped paint, the tattered
hood strapped into an untidy bundle at the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_129' name='Page_129'>[129]</a></span>
back. A pang of acute humiliation gripped
him hard.
</p>

<p>
"Can you do it?" he asked with a sigh.
</p>

<p>
"On low gear," said Hinton. "There is no
doubt that we can do it on low gear. Your
lordship has not perhaps had much experience
of Fords."
</p>

<p>
"None," said Jimmy bitterly.
</p>

<p>
"Then perhaps your lordship will excuse my
saying that a Ford will do anything in low gear."
</p>

<p>
"If so," said Jimmy, with a burst of real
magnanimity, "a Ford is a damned sight
better car than a Pallas Athene eight cylinder
sports model. It won't do anything on any
gear."
</p>

<p>
A really good servant, accustomed to the
best houses, is never found wanting, or unable
to meet any demand made on him. Asked
suddenly in the middle of the afternoon for
tripe and onions he displays no astonishment;
but in a short time brings tripe and onions into
the drawing-room, in a nice dish on a silver
salver. Told, at luncheon, that a complete outfit
for water polo is required immediately afterwards
for a party of eight, he produces, without
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_130' name='Page_130'>[130]</a></span>
fuss or protest, bathing suits, balloons and
everything else required. James Hinton had
been a thoroughly good servant, one of the very
best in England, a country which produces the
best servants in the world.
</p>

<p>
From the locker under the back seat of his
car he took a long and reliable rope. It was as
if he had fully expected to come upon a derelict
Pallas Athene when he left home in the afternoon.
</p>

<p>
The two girls were packed into the back seat of
the Ford with many polite apologies. James
Hinton took his seat, rigidly upright in front.
Jimmy, crushed with shame, crouched over the
steering wheel of the Pallas Athene.
</p>

<p>
The drive began with a gallant effort of
Hinton's to be better than his word. He tried
the Ford on her top gear. She clanged, snorted,
missed fire on one plug after another, made
spasmodic jumps and finally stopped, her engine
stalled. James Hinton got out, worked hard
at the handle for a while and started again.
This time he made no attempt to get out of low
gear. The progress was slow. On the slightest
incline it dropped to about four miles an hour.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_131' name='Page_131'>[131]</a></span>
On a serious hill it became a crawl. Steam rose
from the Ford's radiator like smoke from the
funnel of a locomotive. The water inside
could be heard boiling furiously. Oily smoke
rose occasionally between the floor boards at
Hinton's feet. The noise was terrific. The
heat, even in the back part of the car where the
two girls sat, was great. For Hinton it was
blasting. But he stuck to his post and the car
stuck to its work. She had emerged, a giddy
young thing from the works in Detroit eleven
years before. Time had sobered her, but had
not broken that determination to get somewhere,
somehow, which is the characteristic of
all Fords of all ages.
</p>

<p>
The eight miles to Morriton St. James were
accomplished in something a little over an
hour. The procession stopped at the door of
the principal garage in the town and a crowd
quickly gathered round.
</p>

<p>
"That car," said Jimmy to the proprietor of
the garage, "cost me twelve hundred pounds
this morning. I'll swap it for one like James
Hinton's if you happen to have such a thing in
stock."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_132' name='Page_132'>[132]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The garage owner refused to make the exchange.
He was an honest man and would not
take advantage of a stranger whose nervous
system was wrecked. Besides, it would have
been very difficult to dispose of the Pallas
Athene sports model at any price in Morriton
St. James, a town inhabited by sober and
cautious people.
</p>

<h2>Chapter X</h2>

<p>
James Hinton stood respectfully aside while
Jimmy made his offer to the proprietor of the
garage. When he got his chance to speak, his
voice, like that of every good servant, was
emotionless and soothing.
</p>

<p>
"Excuse my asking you the question, my
lord, but will the ladies be spending the night
at the Manor House?"
</p>

<p>
"They didn't intend to," said Jimmy. "Nor
did I. But we'll all have to now, unless you
feel inclined to run us up to town after dinner
in your Ford."
</p>

<p>
Hinton smiled an entirely respectful appreciation
of this pleasantry.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_133' name='Page_133'>[133]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"I merely asked the question, my lord," he
said, "because I thought it might be well to
make arrangements for bringing up the luggage."
</p>

<p>
It was perfectly apparent that there was no
luggage to bring. The Pallas Athene was not
even fitted with a luggage grid and there were
no bags or suit cases in the car. But Hinton
would have considered it a breach of good
manners to appear to think that two ladies,
companions of Lord Colavon and guests of Sir
Evelyn Dent, could possibly be travelling without
luggage.
</p>

<p>
"Great Scott!" said Jimmy, "I never
thought of that. Of course they haven't got a
blessed thing for the night. Nor have I. It
doesn't matter about me. Uncle Evie can lend
me a razor and a comb. But&mdash;I say, Hinton,
you know all about these things. Do you
think Uncle Evie's housemaid could lend the
ladies what they want?"
</p>

<p>
"I've no doubt that the female members of
the Manor House staff," said Hinton, "will be
able to supply all that is absolutely necessary.
But that is a course which I would hardly
recommend. The garments usually worn by
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_134' name='Page_134'>[134]</a></span>
young persons of that class, my lord, are not
what the ladies are accustomed to."
</p>

<p>
"Housemaids don't run to silk nighties,
Hinton?"
</p>

<p>
"I fear not, my lord."
</p>

<p>
"Then what on earth had we better do?
The shops in this place are sure to be shut by
this time."
</p>

<p>
"If your lordship is willing to leave the
matter in my hands&mdash;&mdash; As it happens Mr.
Linker, the principal ladies' outfitter in Morriton
St. James, is a friend of mine. I intended,
if your lordship will pardon my mentioning my
own affairs&mdash;I intended paying him a visit
this evening. A little matter of business, my
lord. Indeed that was the original purpose of
my visit to Morriton St. James. I feel quite
certain that Mr. Linker will be ready to let the
ladies have what they require."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose that you and Linker between you
will know what they do require."
</p>

<p>
"I venture to hope so, my lord, and I may
add, that although Mr. Linker's establishment
is not quite on a level with the best of the
London houses, he stocks some very high-class
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_135' name='Page_135'>[135]</a></span>
goods. I feel convinced that if the matter
is left in our hands the young ladies will have
no reason to complain."
</p>

<p>
"All right," said Jimmy, "and if your friend
Linker happens to have a suit of pyjamas that
will fit me, and a clean collar, and a brush and
comb&mdash;&mdash;. But I expect it's too much to
expect him to have brushes and combs."
</p>

<p>
"I think, my lord, that through Mr. Linker's
influence in the town all your lordship requires
will be obtainable. May I ask"&mdash;Hinton took
out a slip of paper to make a note of the
important answer to this question, "which
shaving soap your lordship prefers and which
tooth powder?"
</p>

<p>
"Hinton," said Jimmy, "you're invaluable.
Dolly regarded you as a jewel, but he little
knew what you could do. Spotting winners is
nothing to providing three complete trousseaux
at an hour's notice in a small country town.
I don't believe there's another man in England
could do it." He took out his pocket-book.
"Will a ten pound note cover the damage? If
so, keep the change. You deserve it and
more."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_136' name='Page_136'>[136]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Linker will no doubt furnish his account
in due course, my lord," said Hinton.
</p>

<p>
He pocketed the note as he spoke. It is by
such actions that men become rich enough to
buy country inns, refurnish them, and give
fifty pound guarantees to pageants.
</p>

<p>
Jimmy took his seat beside Hinton in the
front of the Ford. The car was now able to
run on high gear, but even so the noise of
their progress was considerable. Quite enough
to render it safe for the passengers in front to
talk without any risk of being overheard by
those behind.
</p>

<p>
Jimmy took advantage of his opportunity.
</p>

<p>
"I say, Hinton, you know Uncle Evie pretty
well, don't you?"
</p>

<p>
"I had the honour of valetting him more
than once when I was first footman in the
service of your lordship's father, the late earl."
</p>

<p>
"Then you must know all there is to know
about his little tempers and fads and so forth.
Just tell me this, speaking quite confidentially&mdash;how
do you think he'll take it when I tell
him that I and the two ladies have come to
stay? He's expecting us to dinner but not for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_137' name='Page_137'>[137]</a></span>
the night. Now what about it, Hinton? Will
there be any unpleasantness? To be quite
candid, I expect we'll be there for the best
part of a week. It will take all that to get
whatever spare parts are wanted for the Pallas
Athene."
</p>

<p>
"I don't happen to know exactly how Sir
Evelyn Dent is situated at the moment, my
lord, but if there is any difficulty with the
domestic staff I shall be only too pleased to
offer my services."
</p>

<p>
"That's kind of you, Hinton, but it's not
exactly what I meant. I was thinking
more&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Quite so, my lord," said Hinton, interrupting
him, but very respectfully. "You're
thinking of the young ladies. So far as waiting
at table is concerned I am quite prepared to
relieve the staff of any extra work. But what
your lordship has in mind is the maiding of the
young ladies. That, I fear, I am not competent
to undertake. But I happen to be aware
that the head of the dressmaking department
in Mr. Linker's establishment was formerly
ladies' maid in some quite good houses. I have
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_138' name='Page_138'>[138]</a></span>
no doubt that in order to oblige she would be
willing to look after the young ladies during
their stay."
</p>

<p>
"Secure her, Hinton, if you think it will
make matters any easier with the Manor House
staff. But it wasn't so much the servants that
I was thinking about. How will Uncle Evie
himself take it? That's the real question."
</p>

<p>
"I've never known Sir Evelyn behave
otherwise than as a perfect gentleman, my
lord."
</p>

<p>
"That's all right as far as it goes, and it's
nice to know that he won't throw stones at
them. But a gentleman, even a perfect gentleman,
can make things damned uncomfortable
for other people when he chooses. Now, will
he? That's the point."
</p>

<p>
"That, my lord," said Hinton, "will depend
a good deal on the young ladies themselves.
I've always understood that Sir Evelyn, when
a young man, was very fond of the society of
ladies, agreeable ladies, if you understand me,
my lord."
</p>

<p>
Hinton's way of saying "agreeable ladies"
left no doubt in Jimmy's mind what kind of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_139' name='Page_139'>[139]</a></span>
ladies he meant. He turned on him rather
angrily.
</p>

<p>
"Don't get it into your head, Hinton, that
I'm travelling about the country with women
of that sort, or that I'd try to foist them on
Uncle Evie if I was."
</p>

<p>
"I beg pardon, my lord," said Hinton in a
tone of great humility. "Nothing was further
from my mind than to suggest anything of
that sort. When I said agreeable I meant
nothing more than sprightly, if I may use the
word."
</p>

<p>
He had meant a great deal more; but Jimmy
accepted the denial.
</p>

<p>
"Any breach of decorum would, I feel sure,
be most objectionable to Sir Evelyn Dent.
But I'm quite sure that there's not the slightest
reason to anticipate such a thing."
</p>

<p>
Jimmy was a quicktempered but easily-pacified
young man. The idea of Beth Appleby
and Mary Lambert earning their board and
lodging by sprightliness tempered with decorum
amused him. He turned round in his seat and
addressed the two girls.
</p>

<p>
"Just listen to this," he said. "We've got
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_140' name='Page_140'>[140]</a></span>
to cadge on Uncle Evie for beds to-night. Must
sleep somewhere, you know, and there isn't
anywhere else. Hinton, who knows all about
everything, says that if you two behave properly
Uncle Evie will be quite kind, so what you've
got to be is&mdash;&mdash; What was the word you used,
Hinton? I know it was a good one."
</p>

<p>
"Sprightly, my lord," said Hinton, "but
I'm not sure whether it would be advisable to
repeat it to the young ladies."
</p>

<p>
"What you've got to be," said Jimmy,
turning to the girls again, "is sprightly."
</p>

<p>
"I'm there all the time in sprightliness,"
said Beth. "That's how I earn my daily
bread. If Lilith didn't lisp with unfailing
sprightliness I'd lose my job."
</p>

<p>
"But at the same time," said Jimmy,
"there mustn't be the slightest breach of
decorum. Hinton says Uncle Evie is a perfect
dragon on decorum."
</p>

<p>
"That's where you'll have to be careful,
Mary, my dear," said Beth.
</p>

<p>
"Me!" said Mary. "I shall be a petrified
icicle with sheer terror. But, I say, Jimmy
does that mean no cigarettes?"
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_141' name='Page_141'>[141]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"What do you say about that, Hinton?"
said Jimmy. "Is Uncle Evie down on women
smoking?"
</p>

<p>
"Many ladies of good position smoke
nowadays, my lord," said Hinton. "I should
imagine that Sir Evelyn Dent is quite
accustomed to it!"
</p>

<p>
"One cigarette after each meal, Mary," said
Jimmy. "Certainly not more."
</p>

<p>
The warnings turned out to be unnecessary.
Sir Evelyn received the girls with dignified,
though slightly pompous, kindness. When he
heard of the failure of the Pallas Athene he at
once offered to put up the whole party for the
night.
</p>

<p>
"My head housemaid seems to be a very
competent young woman," he said to Beth;
"if you'll be so good as to tell her what you
want. This is a bachelor household, I'm afraid,
but the head housemaid is really very resourceful.
You may not be quite as comfortable as
if you'd brought your own luggage&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, that's all right," said Jimmy. "Hinton
happens to know a man who supplies outfits
complete from the cradle to the coffin at ten
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_142' name='Page_142'>[142]</a></span>
minutes' notice. A capital fellow. Baby
clothes and shrouds are all the same to him
and of course anything in between."
</p>

<p>
"How thrilling!" said Beth. "Do you
mean to say that you were arranging all that
while we thought you were swapping your
motor for a Ford? But do you think Hinton
will remember everything? I'd like a toothbrush,
I must say."
</p>

<p>
"Hinton," said Jimmy, "is to be relied on
absolutely."
</p>

<p>
"Hinton?" said Sir Evelyn. "Is that the
man who keeps an inn in a village called Hailey
Compton? If so, I know him, and I really
think, Miss Appleby, that you may rely on
him. He has a knack of getting exactly what
he wants. I've seen a good deal of him during
the last fortnight. He keeps coming here
about a pageant they're getting up. I wonder
what he's doing in Morriton St. James this
evening. Surely he can't be coming to see me
again?"
</p>

<p>
Sir Evelyn had in fact received seven or
eight visits from Hinton, who often brought
Mrs. Eames with him and never came without
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_143' name='Page_143'>[143]</a></span>
a request of some kind. Sir Evelyn, persuaded
by Hinton and talked down by Mrs. Eames,
had already asked some of the most eminent
people in the kingdom to be patrons of the
pageant. He had written several articles on
English smuggling with special allusions to the
pageant&mdash;and persuaded the editors of some of
our leading daily papers to publish them. He
dreaded being asked to do anything more, and
the news that Hinton was in Morriton St. James
made him uneasy. Jimmy reassured him.
</p>

<p>
"He's not after you this time, Uncle Evie.
He's come to see the local underclothes man
on a matter of business. He told me so himself.
I didn't ask what the business was, but
I should say it had something to do with
backing horses. Dolly&mdash;that's Lord Dollman,
you know&mdash;always said that Hinton was A1
for spotting winners. If it wasn't that it was
making money some other way. Hinton's
always there when it comes to gathering in the
cash."
</p>

<p>
"He got five shillings out of me for a glass of
beer the other day," said Sir Evelyn.
</p>

<p>
"That's nothing," said Jimmy. "He had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_144' name='Page_144'>[144]</a></span>
a tenner from me over this outfitting business."
</p>

<p>
"Good gracious, Jimmy!" said Beth. "You
don't mean to say you spent ten pounds on
nighties for me and Mary?"
</p>

<p>
"I meant to," said Jimmy, "but I didn't.
Hinton collared the money and the other fellow's
to send in a bill afterwards."
</p>

<p>
Thus, thanks mainly to the sprightliness of
Lord Colavon, pleasant relations were established
at once, and Sir Evelyn began to enjoy
the society of his guests. He became actually
cordial during dinner when he discovered
that Beth was the author of Lilith's weekly
Lispings.
</p>

<p>
"I am entertaining angels unawares. I have
to thank you, my dear young lady, for the
pleasure your delightful causerie has given me
since I first began to read it."
</p>

<p>
In this Sir Evelyn was perfectly sincere.
Beth, at the instigation of Mrs. Eames, had
written a number of very nice paragraphs about
him. Since his retirement from public life,
after the fall of the Government, his name had
dropped out of the newspapers. He missed,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_145' name='Page_145'>[145]</a></span>
more than he would have cared to confess, the
daily bundle of press cuttings which used to
come to him from an industrious agent in
London. Beth's flattering Lispings were "good
news from a far country," which, as Solomon
says with all his usual wisdom, is like "cold
water to a thirsty soul."
</p>

<p>
"And how is your aunt?" said Sir Evelyn.
"But I dare say I can give you the latest news
of her. She lunched with me three days ago.
We were discussing the details of her very
interesting scheme for a local pageant. Her
idea&mdash;it is entirely hers. I do no more than
help her with such crumbs of historical knowledge
as I possess. Her idea&mdash;but I'm sure
you've heard about it."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, rather," said Beth. "I've heard of
nothing else for weeks. Almost daily letters
from Aunt Agatha. I'm working hard at the
publicity side of the affair. Mary has just
agreed to be a patron as representative of the
dramatic world."
</p>

<p>
"Miss Lambert's name," said Sir Evelyn
with a courteous bow, "will go far to secure
success."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_146' name='Page_146'>[146]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"I'm in it too," said Jimmy. "Beth roped
me in as a patron this morning."
</p>

<p>
"Jimmy represents the world of sport,"
said Beth.
</p>

<p>
"I'm delighted to hear," said Sir Evelyn,
"that Jimmy is going to do something useful
at last. Your good influence, no doubt, Miss
Appleby."
</p>

<p>
"Hang it all, Uncle Evie!" said Jimmy.
"I'm not such a rotter as all that. Look at
the way I've been supporting home industry,
knocking out unemployment and all that sort
of rot by buying cars like the Pallas Athene.
Very few fellows would do it."
</p>

<p>
"You may perhaps be able to help us," said
Sir Evelyn, "in the matter of securing a
suitable lugger. The luggers used in the contraband
trade during the latter part of the
eighteenth century were of the type known as
<i>chasse-marée</i>, designed originally in France.
But I fear that these details will not interest
you young ladies."
</p>

<p>
"They thrill us," said Beth. "Don't they
Mary?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course," said Mary.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_147' name='Page_147'>[147]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
She had been stifling yawns with difficulty
for some time past and feared that a talk
about eighteenth century French boats was not
likely to keep her awake. She just managed
to say her "of course" in tones of conviction.
</p>

<p>
Sir Evelyn suggested that the party should
go to his study, where he could exhibit pictures
of <i>chasse-marées</i>, some of them actually engaged
in smuggling. He had also&mdash;Mary
struggled desperately against overwhelming
sleepiness&mdash;books with diagrams, showing the
lines on which the boats were built.
</p>

<p>
A couple of hours later, when Beth and Mary
had gone to bed, Sir Evelyn had a conversation
with his nephew on a very different subject.
</p>

<p>
The Earl of Colavon ought to marry. This,
in the opinion of the family, was a matter of
duty, and the family had no hesitation about
speaking its mind. Sir Evelyn and four aunts
all spoke their minds plainly and often. Jimmy
was becoming heartily sick of the subject. Sir
Evelyn talked about "the family," which for
the good of society, of England, even of mankind
in general, ought not to be allowed to die
out. That was not how he put it, but it was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_148' name='Page_148'>[148]</a></span>
exactly what he meant. The aunts went
further. After expressing opinions about the
value of "the family" very like those of Sir
Evelyn, they used to produce suitable ladies,
no doubt with the kindly intention of saving
their nephew the trouble of looking out for a
wife for himself. The ladies were not marshalled
in a bevy but thrust on Jimmy's
attention one by one, a second taking the place
of the first when it became clear that the first
was not approved, a third succeeding the second
and so on, until the supply of suitable ladies
was exhausted. This was not so long a business
as might have been expected. There are never
at one time very many ladies suitable for the
position of Countess&mdash;at least, not very many
suitable in the opinion of the aunts of the
Earl of Colavon.
</p>

<p>
When there were no more suitable ladies
the aunts fell back on a hope that Jimmy
would marry someone not entirely unsuitable.
They could not produce anyone of this kind
because they only associated with people whose
daughters were suitable. But they continued
to press this view of his duty on their nephew.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_149' name='Page_149'>[149]</a></span>
So did Sir Evelyn. He displayed a great
broad-mindedness, going so far as to say that
he would be quite ready to welcome even an
actress as a niece&mdash;an actress of good character
and suitable age. The aunts would not, perhaps,
have been quite so liberal.
</p>

<p>
The arrival of Beth Appleby and Mary
Lambert in Jimmy's company cheered Sir
Evelyn. The girls, if not precisely "suitable"
in the full sense of the word, had nice manners,
pleasant tempers and good looks. They were
plainly on very intimate terms with Lord
Colavon, addressing him as Jimmy. Sir Evelyn
felt hopeful; but he was puzzled and a little
annoyed by the fact that there were two girls
and that he was unable to discover that one was
preferred to the other.
</p>

<p>
For some time he skirted round the subject
and Jimmy, who guessed what was coming,
skilfully slipped away from it. At last Sir
Evelyn was reduced to the crude bluntness of
approach which all his political training taught
him to dislike.
</p>

<p>
"I can't help wondering&mdash;&mdash;" he said, "I'm
sure, my dear boy, that you'll excuse my
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_150' name='Page_150'>[150]</a></span>
speaking plainly. I have been wondering all
the evening whether you find yourself seriously
attracted by either of the charming young
ladies who came here with you to-day?"
</p>

<p>
Jimmy, cornered at last, replied with equal
plainness:
</p>

<p>
"I'm seriously attracted," he said, "by both
of them."
</p>

<p>
"I take it," said Sir Evelyn, "that the idea
of marriage with one of them has been present
to your mind."
</p>

<p>
"Never absent from it, Uncle Evie."
</p>

<p>
"My dear boy, I'm delighted to hear it.
Delighted. Now which is it?"
</p>

<p>
"That," said Jimmy, "is precisely my
difficulty. If there was only Mary Lambert
and Beth Appleby did not exist, it would be
perfectly simple. I'd do my best to marry her;
though mind this, Uncle Evie, she might not
be willing to marry me. On the other hand,
if there was no such person as Mary Lambert
I'd make a pretty hard push at marrying Beth
Appleby. I'd call myself a jolly lucky fellow
to get her, or Mary. That's the situation, and
I think you'll agree with me that it's an
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_151' name='Page_151'>[151]</a></span>
uncommonly difficult one. I don't see any
way out, do you?"
</p>

<p>
"That," said Sir Evelyn, "is an absurd,
even an immoral, way to talk, and I should be
seriously angry with you if I thought you meant
it. You must be able to make up your mind
which of the two you prefer."
</p>

<p>
"But that's just it," said Jimmy. "I can't.
My only hope is that some other fellow will come
along and marry one of them. That's what I'm
waiting for, and it's bound to happen sooner
or later, I should think. Then I'll be all there.
If the other fellow marries Beth, I'll have a try
at Mary next day. If, on the other hand, he
marries Mary&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"This incurable habit of flippancy," said
Sir Evelyn irritably, "appears to be growing
on you."
</p>

<p>
"My dear Uncle Evie, I'm as serious as a
judge with a black cap on, and if you like I'll
prove that I mean what I say. Suppose you
chip in and marry one of them&mdash;she might have
you if you asked her nicely&mdash;I'll give you my
word of honour to do my best to marry the other.
I call that a fair offer, and you can count on there
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_152' name='Page_152'>[152]</a></span>
being no ill feeling afterwards, whichever you
take. I shall be perfectly content with the
other, always supposing that she will marry me.
If she won't, then my part of the business is off.
Now what about it?"
</p>

<p>
Sir Evelyn held out his hand with a gesture
of dignified sorrow.
</p>

<p>
"I think perhaps I'd better say good night
to you. There is nothing to be gained by
further discussion along these lines."
</p>

<p>
"Sorry, Uncle Evie, I apologise, grovel, and
all that. But hang it all, you know, you ought
to be fair. You're everlastingly ragging me
about not marrying, and I put up with it like
a lamb. But the very minute I so much as
hint that you might do it yourself&mdash;&mdash; After
all, you're just as unmarried as I am and have
been for double as long; which makes it far
worse. You must be able to see that."
</p>

<p>
In this way Jimmy concealed from an
inquisitive uncle the fact that for some months
he had been trying to persuade Beth Appleby
to marry him and that she had been steadily
but quite good-humouredly refusing to do so.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_153' name='Page_153'>[153]</a></span>
</p>

<h2>Chapter XI</h2>

<p>
Jimmy growled a sleepy "Come in" in reply to
a tap at his bedroom door. Having thus
accomplished all that could be expected of him
for some time he relapsed into deep slumber
again. There was nothing to disturb him in
the familiar performance of the servant who
called him. A tea tray was laid down noiselessly
on the table beside his bed. Curtains
were drawn back as nearly noiselessly as curtains
could be drawn. There was the usual folding of
shirts and socks, laying out of shoes, arrangement
of other clothes in due order, the depositing
in appropriate places of collar, tie and handkerchief.
The same things were done for Jimmy
every morning of his life and had been done for
him in much the same way ever since he had left
school. There was nothing to disturb him and
he was too sleepy to realise that he was in a
strange room.
</p>

<p>
"Your lordship's bath," said the servant,
"will be prepared. I shall return and tell
your lordship when it is ready. In about
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_154' name='Page_154'>[154]</a></span>
ten minutes if that is convenient to your lordship."
</p>

<p>
The voice was unfamiliar. Jimmy opened
his eyes sufficiently to recognise that the servant
who was leaving the room was not his own
man. He saw at the same time that he was
in an unfamiliar room. The recollection of the
adventures of the day before came to him and
he knew that he had slept in his uncle's house.
He poured out his tea and as he drank it
composed a biting and insulting telegram to
be sent, regardless of expense, to the makers of
the Pallas Athene sports model car. He lit
a cigarette to stimulate the workings of his
brain.
</p>

<p>
The servant came into the room again, as he
promised, in ten minutes. Jimmy recognised
Hinton.
</p>

<p>
"Hallo!" he said. "How do you come to
be here?"
</p>

<p>
"Your lordship will recollect that I ventured
to suggest last night that it might be convenient
if I were to wait upon your lordship."
</p>

<p>
"Of course. Yes. Now you mention it, I
remember. You said you'd come in to help
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_155' name='Page_155'>[155]</a></span>
Uncle Evie's butler in case the poor fellow felt
overworked. Uncommonly kind of you to do
it, Hinton, and I'm sure we're all greatly obliged
to you. You were to have got tooth-brushes and
things for the two young ladies. I hope you
did."
</p>

<p>
"I left that matter in Mr. Linker's hands, my
lord, with every confidence that satisfaction
would be given. Mr. Linker's establishment is
not actually first class. That could hardly be
expected in Morriton St. James, but I think
everything required will be provided. The
young person of whom I spoke to you last
night&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He went on to say at some length, that the
head of the dressmaking department in Mr.
Linker's shop had consented to return,
temporarily, to her original trade, and was at
that moment acting as lady's maid to Beth and
Mary. Jimmy suspected that neither of the
girls was accustomed to such ministrations, but
had no doubt they would enjoy them. Mr.
Linker, it appeared, had been quite willing to
give his dressmaker a holiday; such was his
respect for Sir Evelyn and his desire to be
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_156' name='Page_156'>[156]</a></span>
obliging. Hinton said nothing about the feelings
of Mr. Linker's customers, the young ladies
of Morriton St. James, several of whom were
waiting impatiently, even clamorously, for new
dresses.
</p>

<p>
"It's uncommonly civil of your friend
Linker," said Jimmy. "You might thank
him from me, will you?"
</p>

<p>
"I have reason to believe, my lord, that
Mr. Linker proposes to call on you himself
this morning."
</p>

<p>
"With the bill for the night dresses and
things, I suppose?"
</p>

<p>
Hinton was profoundly shocked by the
suggestion.
</p>

<p>
"Certainly not, my lord. Mr. Linker understands
your lordship's position in society too
well to send in an account in anything less than
three months. I should certainly not have
recommended Mr. Linker to your lordship's
notice if there had been the least risk of his being
guilty of such an act of indecorum. The fact
is, my lord"&mdash;here Hinton's tone became
confidential&mdash;"Mr. Linker wishes to ask a
favour, and I may add that if your lordship
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_157' name='Page_157'>[157]</a></span>
sees your way to consider Mr. Linker's proposal
favourably, I shall regard it as a favour to
myself."
</p>

<p>
"What does he want, Hinton? If I can do
anything in the way of recommending him to
Uncle Evie&mdash;&mdash; Contract for the supply of
caps and aprons for the housemaids here, or
anything of that sort, I shall be delighted.
A man who can provide trousseaux complete
with lady's maid at ten minutes' notice after
the shops are shut deserves any recommendation
I can give."
</p>

<p>
"I gather, my lord, that Mr. Linker's request
is not connected with the ladies' outfitting
business."
</p>

<p>
"If he wants to buy what's left of the Pallas
Athene," said Jimmy, "he can have it cheap."
</p>

<p>
Hinton allowed himself a respectful smile.
</p>

<p>
"I gathered from what Mr. Linker said to me
that he wishes to see your lordship with reference
to the coming pageant at Hailey Compton."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, that's it, is it? Now how the devil
does a shopkeeper in Morriton St. James come
to be mixed up in a pageant at Hailey Compton?
What business is it of his?"
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_158' name='Page_158'>[158]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Hinton produced a long, plausible and quite
unconvincing explanation of Linker's interest
in the pageant. He was, it appears, an active
politician, a supporter of the party to which
Sir Evelyn belonged. He took the chair at
political meetings. He was president of a club
by means of which it was hoped that working
men might be attached to the party. He was
very anxious to secure Sir Evelyn's return at
the next election.
</p>

<p>
"I know that kind of fellow," said Jimmy.
"Invaluable, of course, but boring. I quite
see that Uncle Evie has to put up with him.
'How to be civil though yawning. A Tract
for Parliamentary Candidates.' But I'm not
in that line myself and I don't see why I should
be worried by your friend Linker. And anyhow,
what has all that got to do with the pageant?"
</p>

<p>
Hinton's explanation went on. Mr. Linker
had conceived the idea that the position of the
party in the constituency would be improved
if the pageant, with which Sir Evelyn was
intimately connected, were a real success.
</p>

<p>
"I don't see that in the least," said Jimmy.
"As a matter of fact, there are two or three other
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_159' name='Page_159'>[159]</a></span>
things about that pageant that I don't quite
see. But I'm always stupid till I have had my
bath. Can't understand how any fellow is
expected to be at his brightest and best till he's
wallowed about in cold water a bit. Suppose
you drop in here while I'm dressing, Hinton,
and we'll have a chat."
</p>

<p>
"I shall be quite at your lordship's service
at any time," said Hinton.
</p>

<p>
Jimmy returned from his bath thoroughly
awake and as fit as he ever would be to deal with
the puzzling problem of Linker's interest in the
pageant. He had indeed, while drying himself,
hit on a new question to which he wanted to
find an answer. Why was Hinton himself so
eager about the pageant? Sir Evelyn had
mentioned the guarantee fund and Hinton's
fifty pound promise. There must, Jimmy
supposed, be some reason for such generosity.
He wanted to find out what it was.
</p>

<p>
"Now, Hinton," he said, "just tell me all
over again why your friend Linker thinks that
this pageant will win the election for Uncle
Evie."
</p>

<p>
Hinton was apparently not pleased with this
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_160' name='Page_160'>[160]</a></span>
inquiry. His reply was a perfectly courteous
and respectful rebuke of Lord Colavon's
curiosity.
</p>

<p>
"That, my lord, is a point on which I am
unable to give you any information. But Mr.
Linker is very experienced in elections and
thoroughly understands the sort of appeal
which impresses the voter. I think perhaps
we may safely leave the matter in his hands."
</p>

<p>
Jimmy rubbed shaving soap on his face
thoughtfully for a minute. Then he asked
Hinton another question.
</p>

<p>
"I understand that you're in this pageant
up to your neck, Hinton. Now why?"
</p>

<p>
Hinton glanced sharply at Lord Colavon's
face reflected in the mirror. It was covered
with a foam of white soap and no face in that
state looks intelligent. Hinton decided that
nothing more than an evasive answer was
necessary.
</p>

<p>
"I am certainly interested, my lord."
</p>

<p>
Jimmy laid down his shaving brush and took
up his razor. After giving his chin a scrape he
turned to Hinton again.
</p>

<p>
"As an historical archæologist," he said,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_161' name='Page_161'>[161]</a></span>
"you are, of course, interested in any effort
to re-create the past."
</p>

<p>
Hinton was a little puzzled. His safest plan
seemed to be to say nothing.
</p>

<p>
"And the artistic side of the thing appeals
to you strongly," said Jimmy.
</p>

<p>
Hinton, still puzzled, and becoming uneasy,
bowed gravely.
</p>

<p>
"Remarkable man you are, Hinton," said
Jimmy. "And your friend Linker, the shopkeeper,
is a remarkable man, too. Suppose
now you tell me all about this pageant, just who
else is in it besides you and Uncle Evie and
what's going on and how far you've got."
</p>

<p>
Hinton was perfectly willing to tell a good
deal, if not actually all there was to tell, about
the pageant.
</p>

<p>
He gave a list of the patrons so far. He
described Mrs. Eames at some length. He
described the vicar, who continued to live a
secluded life, chiefly in the church, taking no
part in the village activities. He described the
rehearsals, held daily at high tide. Bales of
goods and small casks, lent by Hinton himself,
were landed at every high tide out of one of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_162' name='Page_162'>[162]</a></span>
Bunce's boats. Songs, which Mrs. Eames called
chanties, were sung as the work went on.
Sometimes the cargo, when landed, was stored
in the cave. Sometimes it was carried across
the beach, with the accompaniment of other
chanties, and loaded on the back of the only
horse which Mrs. Eames had been able to borrow.
Unfortunately, the first enthusiasm of the
village was dying away. The daily rehearsals
were felt to be tiresome. It required all the
influence of Hinton himself, Bunce and some
of the older men, to keep the people at work.
</p>

<p>
Costumes, designed by Sir Evelyn, were being
made in Morriton St. James under the supervision
of Mr. Linker, who had undertaken that
part of the work.
</p>

<p>
"Sees his way to making a bit, I suppose,"
said Jimmy acutely. "I thought there must
be money in it for him somewhere."
</p>

<p>
"No doubt, my lord, there will be the usual
profit on the sale of the costumes."
</p>

<p>
"But not much," said Jimmy, "hardly
enough to make it worth his while to plunge into
the thing and go pursuing people like me and
Uncle Evie. And where do you come in,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_163' name='Page_163'>[163]</a></span>
Hinton? I mean to say, apart from your
interest in English history and village art, what
made you guarantee fifty pounds?"
</p>

<p>
James Hinton smiled but gave no answer
to this question. He offered instead a description
of a picture of a smuggling lugger which
hung in the tap-room of the Anchor Inn, ready
to be inspected by anyone interested in the
pageant. It had been painted by a young man,
a nephew of Mr. Linker's, who had won several
prizes for art given by the County Education
Committee. The details of the hull and rigging
had been worked out under the direction of
Sir Evelyn. The sea which surrounded the
lugger, the work of the young man himself, was
highly spirited and very blue.
</p>

<p>
Jimmy listened to all this without comment.
The picture of the lugger did not interest him.
He had finished shaving and was washing his
face. Hinton went on to explain at some
length why he and Linker were anxious to secure
Lord Colavon's support for the pageant. They
had got a bishop, a couple of leading politicians,
a judge and a doctor with a title. They now
wanted to reach another section of the public,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_164' name='Page_164'>[164]</a></span>
sporting people and theatrical people. They
hoped that Lord Colavon, if he supported the
pageant, would interest his friends in it.
</p>

<p>
"I see," said Jimmy, drying his face. "But
what I want to know is, what do I get out of it?
Uncle Evie wins an election. Your friend
Linker scoops in a profit for costumes. You
gratify your passion for archæology. But
where do I come in?"
</p>

<p>
"I was in hopes," said Hinton, rather feebly,
"that your lordship might find it amusing.
Mrs. Eames is a very remarkable lady. I feel
convinced that you will enjoy meeting Mrs.
Eames."
</p>

<p>
"Hardly good enough, Hinton. I'm sure
Mrs. Eames is all you say. But I have some
respect for the Church, even if you haven't, and
I never flirt with parsons' wives."
</p>

<p>
Having finished washing he began to dress.
Hinton offered him all kinds of unnecessary
assistance and for a while nothing more was
said. At last, fully clothed, except for his coat
and waistcoat, Jimmy sat down and lit a
cigarette.
</p>

<p>
"Now, Hinton," he said, "you've told me a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_165' name='Page_165'>[165]</a></span>
lot about this pageant, and it's only fair that I
should tell you something. Sit down and listen
to me for a minute. Smoke if you like."
</p>

<p>
Hinton preferred to stand&mdash;or said he did&mdash;and
refused the offer of a cigarette. Jimmy began:
</p>

<p>
"My idea of the day of your pageant is
something like this. Crowds on the shore.
Village people dressed up as assistant smugglers
waiting for the arrival of the lugger. Everybody
anxiously peering out to sea. Distinguished
visitors in the reserved seats scanning
the horizon with telescopes. Uncle Evie with a
telescope. The bishop with binoculars. Other
eminent men with field glasses. Women asking
stupid questions in order to keep conversation
going. Everybody jumping with excitement and
expectation till the lugger comes in sight. Then
cheers. Loud cheers. That's about the programme
so far, isn't it, Hinton?"
</p>

<p>
"That, my lord, is very much what we hope
to accomplish."
</p>

<p>
"Exactly. But before your lugger comes in
sight she must have been somewhere out of
sight. That's only common sense. You follow
me so far."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_166' name='Page_166'>[166]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Certainly, my lord, out of sight. Certainly."
</p>

<p>
"Very well. Where was she before she came
into sight? Tell me that?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm not quite sure that I catch your lordship's
meaning."
</p>

<p>
"I'll try and make it plainer for you if you
like. The lugger was out of sight at one time.
Very well. A little later she comes into sight.
I know there's a school of philosophers which
says that a thing simply doesn't exist unless
somebody's looking at it. And of course if that's
true there's no use asking questions about
where the lugger was before the bishop and
Uncle Evie saw it through their glasses. It
just wasn't anywhere. In fact there wasn't a
lugger. But you and I don't believe that, do
we? We can't, you know, because we both
intend to be on board that lugger, and we'd
hate to pass out of existence till Uncle Evie and
the bishop chose to see us. We may take it
then, that the lugger was somewhere before she
came in sight. But where? That's what I
want to get at."
</p>

<p>
"I don't think that point's been considered,
my lord."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_167' name='Page_167'>[167]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Well, it ought to be and I'm going to consider
it now. The lugger might have been at
St. Malo, or Granville, or Cherbourg, or any
port along that bit of coast. Or she might
have been in St. Helier, or Peter's Port, or some
little bay in one of the Channel Islands. And if
she was&mdash;mind I'm only saying if&mdash;I suppose you
might make a nice little sum over a few dozen
cases of French brandy that didn't pay duty.
And your friend Linker could do with a consignment
of French silk, duty free. I could manage
along with a case or two of champagne and a
few silk stockings for these young ladies. You
see how the thing works out, Hinton. Immense
crowds on shore. All the most eminent
and respectable people looking on. Lugger
comes in. Motor engine on board, not a Pallas
Athene sports model engine, but one something
more on the lines of your Ford. Flag flies at
truck, skull and crossbones and all that. Thrills.
Cheers. Newspaper men writing like fury.
Photographers snapping their camera shutters.
Publicity. Widest possible publicity. Dummy
cargo landed. Pack horses loaded. Bales carried
into cave. Cheers die down. Show over.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_168' name='Page_168'>[168]</a></span>
Crowds disperse to eat and drink. Then you
and I and Linker land another little cargo."
</p>

<p>
"That, my lord, would, I fear, be smuggling."
</p>

<p>
"You might call it that."
</p>

<p>
"The penalties for smuggling are very severe,
my lord."
</p>

<p>
"I'm disappointed in you, Hinton. I thought
you were a sportsman. Lord Dollman said you
were a sportsman, and I believed him. But here
you are funking a little flutter, when it's odds
on, positively odds on. I should say nine to
one on."
</p>

<p>
"The custom house officers are very alert,
my lord, very alert indeed, and they're sure to
be particularly suspicious of a pageant like
this. The very word smuggling, advertised as
we hope to advertise it, is enough to make them
watch us."
</p>

<p>
"That's just where you're wrong," said
Jimmy. "It's our advertising which will put
them off. Nobody who wanted to smuggle
would put a paragraph to say so in every paper
in England. Nobody who meant to smuggle
would invite Uncle Evie and the bishop and all
the other political and legal swells to be directors
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_169' name='Page_169'>[169]</a></span>
in the company. Don't you see, Hinton, that's
just the sort of thing that puts the intelligent
custom house officer off the scent, and the more
intelligent he is the certainer he's bound to be
that there's nothing in it."
</p>

<p>
The reasoning was perfectly sound and ought
to have convinced Hinton. Perhaps it did.
Perhaps he had thought it all out himself before.
But there was another difficulty which seemed
less easy to deal with.
</p>

<p>
"You'll excuse me, my lord, but neither Mr.
Linker nor I would care to take part in a scheme
for defrauding the Revenue."
</p>

<p>
"Rot!" said Jimmy. "You really can't
expect me to believe that, Hinton. Nobody
could take that line. Just think how the good
old Revenue defrauds us. It was only the other
day I caught it at it. At least another fellow
to whom I gave over the job caught it for me.
And the thing had been going on for years.
Income Tax. Hundreds of pounds that I
oughtn't to have paid. I expect it's been doing
the same thing to you and to Linker and Uncle
Evie and everyone. So far as I can make out
it defrauds everyone it can, and when it's caught
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_170' name='Page_170'>[170]</a></span>
doesn't even apologise. Now what's wrong
about getting a bit of our own back? That's all
we intend to do."
</p>

<p>
But Hinton remained obstinately unconvinced
even by this argument. He shook his
head gravely and sadly, adding a few words
about Mr. Linker's integrity and his own high
principles.
</p>

<p>
Jimmy threw away the end of his cigarette.
Then he slipped on his waistcoat and coat.
</p>

<p>
"Very well, Hinton," he said, "I'll have
nothing whatever to do with your measly
pageant, and what's more I'll crab it in every
way I possibly can. I'll take care, so far as my
friends are concerned, that it's a complete washout.
I know perfectly well that you and Linker,
and I expect half the fishermen in the village,
are going to do exactly what I've said. Why
the devil else should you be going into the thing
at all, spending money and so on? If you won't
let me chip in along with the rest of you, I'll do
you all the harm I can, and you can tell your
friend Linker what I say. If he calls here this
morning I simply won't see him. You can tell
him that, too."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_171' name='Page_171'>[171]</a></span>
</p>

<h2>Chapter XII</h2>

<p>
Mr. Linker presented himself&mdash;the phrase is a
most unpleasant one. No self-respecting writer
would use it if he could find any other to express
his meaning. He would prefer to say
"Mr. Linker arrived" or "Mr. Linker came."
Or perhaps "Mr. Linker turned up," or "blew
in." Unfortunately "presented himself" is the
only way of describing the unctuous politeness,
the self-satisfied smugness, the deprecating
humility and the formal correctness with which
Mr. Linker, at the Manor House door, asked for
Lord Colavon. It is therefore necessary to use
the words.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Linker presented himself, early, while Sir
Evelyn and his guests were still lingering over
breakfast. He was shown into the library and
his presence announced by Hinton.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Linker," he said to Jimmy, "wishes to
speak to your lordship when convenient."
</p>

<p>
"Tell the blighter," said Jimmy, "to call
again this day fortnight and say that I won't be
here then."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_172' name='Page_172'>[172]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
He looked Hinton straight in the face as he
spoke. His meaning was perfectly clear. He
was fulfilling the threat that he had made an
hour before in his bedroom.
</p>

<p>
Sir Evelyn, who was enjoying the society of
the two girls, did not want to be disturbed.
But he was aware of Linker's political importance
and was most unwilling to offend him.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps," he said, "I'd better see him."
</p>

<p>
"Don't do anything of the sort, Uncle Evie,"
said Jimmy. "I know that kind of rotter and, if he
once gets talking you'll not stop him under an hour
and a half. Just let Hinton take my message."
</p>

<p>
Sir Evelyn hesitated. He knew that, once
caught by Linker, his morning would be gone,
and he had been looking forward to taking Beth
Appleby and Mary Lambert round his rock
garden. They were very agreeable and well-mannered
young women. Jimmy might have
had his way and the message might have been
sent&mdash;though perhaps not delivered&mdash;by Hinton,
if Beth had not recognised the name of Linker.
She had heard a good deal about him from the
dressmaker maid and knew that he was the man
who had supplied her and Mary with clothes.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_173' name='Page_173'>[173]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Let me go and see him," she said. "I want
to thank him for the lovely things he sent, and
so does Mary. We'll both go. If I could
afford it I'd order half a dozen nighties of
the same pattern. I never had anything so
deliciously frivolous before."
</p>

<p>
"Offer him a free advertisement in Lilith's
Lispings," said Jimmy, "and perhaps he'll give
you a few."
</p>

<p>
"I might do that," said Beth. "It would
be a paragraph practically ready-made for next
week, and that's something, even if I don't get
as much as a pocket handkerchief out of him.
And I ought to. 'Lilith lisps that Mr. Linker,
the well-known lingerie expert of Morriton St.
James, who is perhaps England's greatest artist
in nightdresses, is about to startle the world
with an original design in&mdash;whisper, belovedest,
if there are any men in the room&mdash;cami-knickers.
Anyone with a real regard for undies&mdash;and
which of us has not?&mdash;will at once write to&mdash;&mdash;'
I must ask him his address when I see him.
Come on, Mary, and let's try. An ad. like that
ought to be worth something."
</p>

<p>
"Suppose we all go," said Sir Evelyn,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_174' name='Page_174'>[174]</a></span>
still anxious to be polite to the influential
Linker.
</p>

<p>
"I shan't stir a step," said Jimmy. "I hate
that kind of oily beggar."
</p>

<p>
Hinton held the door open for the two ladies
and Sir Evelyn. When they had left the room
he turned to Jimmy.
</p>

<p>
"Beg pardon, my lord," he said, "I took the
opportunity of speaking a few words to Mr.
Linker before announcing him."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you did, did you? I hope you told him
not to allow anyone to tempt him into trying
to defraud the revenue."
</p>

<p>
Hinton smiled feebly.
</p>

<p>
"I understood from Mr. Linker," he said,
"that he was inclined to consider your lordship's
proposal sympathetically."
</p>

<p>
"He'll have to do a great deal more than
consider it. However, if he's got that far I may
as well see him."
</p>

<p>
Linker was a disagreeable little man with a
pallid face, almost colourless shifty eyes and
damp hands. He received Beth's thanks with
many bows, but did not seem much excited by
her offer of an advertisement in Lilith's Lispings.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_175' name='Page_175'>[175]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Very much obliged to your ladyship, I'm
sure," was all he said.
</p>

<p>
He addressed Mary Lambert as "your ladyship"
too, being perhaps under the impression
that any ladies who associated on good terms
with an earl must have titles of their own.
He got away from the subject of his own
business as soon as Jimmy entered the
room, and made his appeal on behalf of the
pageant.
</p>

<p>
He said very much what Hinton had said in
the morning, dwelling on the political advantage
to Sir Evelyn of being associated with a popular
and successful pageant&mdash;an advantage not at all
obvious to anyone else&mdash;and the value to the
pageant of Lord Colavon's help, which was, if
possible, less obvious still.
</p>

<p>
"I told Hinton to tell you," said Jimmy,
"that I'm not going to touch your pageant.
I'm not going to have anything to do with it.
I'm not even going to see it."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Jimmy," said Mary, "it might be
rather fun."
</p>

<p>
"Aunt Agatha's pageant!" said Beth.
"You must help if you can, though I don't see
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_176' name='Page_176'>[176]</a></span>
what good you can do except being a patron, and
you're that already."
</p>

<p>
"Now, I might be useful," said Mary&mdash;"really
useful. I'm an actress, Mr. Linker."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed, your ladyship?" said Linker.
</p>

<p>
He did not seem impressed by this announcement.
He perhaps thought that Mrs. Eames
was capable of managing the acting part of it
by herself.
</p>

<p>
"I've always longed to produce a play," said
Mary, "and a pageant would be nearly as good."
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry your mind is so definitely made
up," said Sir Evelyn to Jimmy. "Mr. Linker
seems to think&mdash;&mdash; The prospects of the Party
in Morriton St. James&mdash;my own position as
prospective candidate&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"If it's going to help you, Uncle Evie&mdash;but
I'm blest if I see how it can."
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Linker," said Sir Evelyn, "attaches
great importance to the success of the pageant.
I think perhaps that you ought&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I need scarcely say, my lord," said Linker,
"that in the management of the pageant we
should be prepared to meet your lordship's
wishes in every way."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_177' name='Page_177'>[177]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"In every way?"
</p>

<p>
Jimmy looked Linker straight in the face and
then turned his eyes on Hinton, who was
standing near the door.
</p>

<p>
"In <i>every</i> way," said Linker, nervously but
with the needed emphasis.
</p>

<p>
"Certainly, my lord," said Hinton, "in
every way."
</p>

<p>
"Very well," said Jimmy. "As you all
want me I'll do my best; but what exactly is
it that you expect me to do?"
</p>

<p>
"Get me a job with a good advertisement
attached to it," said Mary.
</p>

<p>
"Help Aunt Agatha," said Beth.
</p>

<p>
Linker explained his wishes at greater length.
Lord Colavon might undertake the purchase
of the lugger and allow that fact to be advertised.
He might superintend the rigging under
the direction of Sir Evelyn. He might interest
his friends in the pageant.
</p>

<p>
"And steer the lugger when the great day
comes," said Jimmy.
</p>

<p>
"Certainly, if your lordship wishes."
</p>

<p>
The assurance was definite enough and entirely
satisfactory to Jimmy. The conversation
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_178' name='Page_178'>[178]</a></span>
passed on to the subject of patrons of the
pageant. Linker pressed on Sir Evelyn, who
had already done a great deal, the necessity
of securing as many influential names as
possible.
</p>

<p>
"Another bishop would be very desirable,
sir," he said.
</p>

<p>
"But why do you want so many bishops?"
said Mary. "Aren't they very liable to make
objections? My Nautch Girl dance is perfectly
all right, but&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Although a Nonconformist myself," said
Linker, "I cannot but be aware of the social
position of the dignitaries of the Established
Church. They would certainly be of great
value to the pageant."
</p>

<p>
He mentioned in a reverential whisper the
name of a popular ecclesiastic, one of the few
who are thoroughly well known to the public
outside church circles.
</p>

<p>
"If a few actresses would be of any use,"
said Mary, "I might get them."
</p>

<p>
"As skittish as possible," said Jimmy.
"Some ladies of the gayer kind will be wanted
to balance all the bishops."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_179' name='Page_179'>[179]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"And if," Linker addressed Sir Evelyn again,
"you could see your way to inviting&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He named a very great statesman, a man
with a European reputation for the astute
manipulation of international Congresses,
Assemblies of the League of Nations and such
things.
</p>

<p>
"Not necessarily to be present at the
pageant," said Linker apologetically. "That
would be asking too much. But if we might
make use of his name."
</p>

<p>
"Do get him, Sir Evelyn," said Beth. "He'd
be worth pounds to me in paragraphs. He and
the bishops and Mary's actresses all together."
</p>

<p>
Linker went on doggedly and shamelessly
with his suggestions. There was scarcely anyone
of eminence whom he did not suggest,
except members of the Royal Family, and Sir
Evelyn fully expected him to ask for a prince
or two soon. He seemed to be working up in
that direction, and at last, when he was plainly
getting to the end of his list, he hesitated and
apologised over a final name. It would scarcely
have surprised anyone if he had mentioned the
King himself.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_180' name='Page_180'>[180]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"And perhaps," he said, "we might secure
the name of&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He looked round among his listeners as if
uncertain to whom he ought to appeal for the
man he wanted.
</p>

<p>
"The name of Mr. East," he said at last,
"would be of the greatest value to us."
</p>

<p>
"Mr. East?" said Sir Evelyn vaguely.
</p>

<p>
He had never heard of Mr. East.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. E. P. East," said Linker, as if that
explained the thing.
</p>

<p>
"Who is he?" said Sir Evelyn.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. E. P. East," said Linker, "is the Head
Surveyor of Customs and Excise in this
district."
</p>

<p>
Beth and Mary were totally uninterested in
this suggestion. The name of Mr. E. P. East
would be useless for a paragraph and promised
no desirable publicity. Sir Evelyn was still as
much puzzled as when he first heard the name.
He failed to see the value of Mr. East as a
patron.
</p>

<p>
"Of course," he said, "if you really want
him I might be able to secure him."
</p>

<p>
Jimmy, after looking hard at Linker's totally
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_181' name='Page_181'>[181]</a></span>
expressionless face, turned away and whistled
softly.
</p>

<h2>Chapter XIII</h2>

<p>
The interview with Linker dragged itself to an
end at last and the man bowed himself out of
the room. Sir Evelyn took the two girls out
to his rock garden and enjoyed himself. He
had long been cut off from the society of
cheerful and pretty young women who wanted
to be agreeable to him and were clever enough
to show an interest, which no one under
fifty can really feel, in the names and nature
of unattractive plants. Sir Evelyn, though old
enough to enjoy rock plants, was not too old
to enjoy pretty girls. A happy position and
rare, for as a rule rock plants only become
interesting after pretty girls have ceased to
attract.
</p>

<p>
Jimmy settled down for an hour's serious
work in the butler's pantry where the Manor
House telephone was kept. He began with
the proprietor of the garage in Morriton St.
James, went into all the symptoms of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_182' name='Page_182'>[182]</a></span>
Pallas Athene's breakdown, found that a
diagnosis had been made and that a major
operation would be required. There was little
hope of the car running again for a week. After
that he tried a trunk call to the office of the
makers of the car. This was a difficult thing
to procure but he did it in the end and had
the satisfaction of telling a gentleman, described
to him as "the boss" exactly what sort of
car the Pallas Athene was. "The boss"
retaliated by describing in vivid terms the kind
of man who was fool enough to drive a perfectly
new car, which had never been run in, at the
rate of sixty miles an hour for several hundred
miles.
</p>

<p>
He had no direct evidence that the Pallas
Athene had been driven in this way, but he
knew something of Jimmy's reputation as a
motorist, and he felt quite safe in making the
accusation.
</p>

<p>
It is creditable to Jimmy that he kept his
temper during both conversations. The garage
proprietor kept his and the "boss" only pretended
to be angry as a means of self-defence
against any claim which might be made on him
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_183' name='Page_183'>[183]</a></span>
under the terms of his guarantee. Considering
how trying motor cars can be when they choose
to behave badly this general self-restraint
goes far to show that we are really becoming a
civilised people, a thing which observers of our
habit of going on strike might be inclined to
doubt.
</p>

<p>
When Sir Evelyn and the two girls returned
from the rock garden Jimmy told them the
news that there was no chance of getting away
in the Pallas Athene. He spoke indecisively
about trains and still more doubtfully about
hiring another car. Sir Evelyn cut him short
with a hospitable invitation to the whole party
to stay with him for a week or a fortnight, until
the Pallas Athene was repaired, or perhaps
until the Hailey Compton pageant was over.
</p>

<p>
Beth murmured a polite refusal which it was
quite clear she did not really mean. Pressed
by Sir Evelyn she confessed that gossip about
London society can be invented anywhere and
that the Lispings of Lilith could be just as
well written in the Manor House at Morriton
St. James as in the flat in Battersea. She also
said something about an opportunity for visiting
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_184' name='Page_184'>[184]</a></span>
her aunt at Hailey Compton. Sir Evelyn cut
her short.
</p>

<p>
"You will be doing me a favour," he said,
"by staying on till the pageant is over. I
want someone to help me through with that
affair."
</p>

<p>
Mary Lambert was franker. She had no
work to do in London. There was a possibility
of her getting a job, in connection with the
pageant, which, even if unpaid would bring her
name before the public. She was also, though
she only hinted at this, much more comfortable
in the Manor House than she had ever been
anywhere in her life before, and&mdash;this consideration
weighs a little with all of us&mdash;it is
very convenient to be housed and fed free,
especially when earning no salary. A few
clothes&mdash;she and Beth said this simultaneously&mdash;could
be sent for from London.
</p>

<p>
Jimmy had no hesitation about accepting
the invitation. He, perhaps he alone, took his
uncle's polite assurance at its face value.
</p>

<p>
"You do want someone to look after you,
Uncle Evie," he said, "and that's a fact. I'm
not saying anything against Hinton or Linker,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_185' name='Page_185'>[185]</a></span>
not a word. Both excellent fellows, no doubt.
But they give me the impression of being pretty
sharp men of business. When I think of that
tenner of mine which Hinton trousered yesterday
afternoon, and of what Linker's little bill
will probably be I tremble to think of the extent
to which the two of them will probably stick
you."
</p>

<p>
Sir Evelyn smiled amiably at the suggestion
that he needed a protector and made a mild
joke about his nephew's fitness for the part of
tutor to innocent old age.
</p>

<p>
"Besides," Jimmy went on, "I'm getting
quite keen on this pageant of yours and rather
see myself in the part of captain of the lugger."
</p>

<p>
When it was settled that the whole party
would remain at the Manor House Jimmy suggested
a drive over to Hailey Compton as a
suitable amusement for the day. Like most
men over fifty Sir Evelyn dreaded picnics and
suggested that they should lunch comfortably
at home before starting. He was strongly
opposed to Beth's suggestion that they should
ask Mrs. Eames for luncheon. But neither
Beth nor Mary wanted to spend the rest of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_186' name='Page_186'>[186]</a></span>
morning in the rock garden, and a compromise
was arranged. The party would take its own
food, but eat it, along with anything Mrs.
Eames provided, in the vicarage. This, like
most compromises, combined the most objectionable
features of both plans. The food would
be picnic food, cold, sandwichy and scrappy,
which was exactly what Sir Evelyn disliked.
The company would be that of Mrs. Eames,
which he dreaded.
</p>

<p>
An hour and a half later Sir Evelyn's little
car, this time driven in masterful fashion by
Jimmy, reached the long stretch of bare, undulating
land above Hailey Compton. The
road, a narrow white belt, stretched straight
until it seemed to end abruptly on the very
edge of the cliff. The car sped on faster than
that car had ever gone before. Jimmy eyed
the road in front of him suspiciously.
</p>

<p>
"Is there a way down," he said, "or do we
stop here and take to parachutes?"
</p>

<p>
"It's very steep," said Sir Evelyn. "Do be
careful."
</p>

<p>
"Brakes all right?" said Jimmy without
slowing down.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_187' name='Page_187'>[187]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"I hope so. I trust so," said his uncle.
</p>

<p>
Jimmy, though daring, was not reckless.
With rapid motion of hand and foot he changed
gear. The car sped forward with a shrill cry.
Jimmy changed gear again, and took the first
of the sharp bends at a little over twenty-five
miles an hour. His passengers clung tightly
to the sides of the car. The brakes stuttered.
The low gear cried more shrilly. Another
corner was safely passed.
</p>

<p>
"Nasty place on a foggy night," said Jimmy,
"if you happened to be trying it for the first
time."
</p>

<p>
He went boldly on, for it was neither night
nor foggy. The sun glittered on a calm sea
far below them. The steep, thatched roofs of
the fishermen's cottages were seen, as roofs
seldom are except by those who go about in
aeroplanes. The little boat haven, in reality a
slimy pool, looked like a glowing gem. The
vicarage, somewhat apart from the village, was
modestly picturesque like a shy girl in light
summer clothes. The church, its squat, grey
tower bathed in sunlight, stood on guard
above the village, perched on the little plateau,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_188' name='Page_188'>[188]</a></span>
the sea and the cliffs below it, a tall, rugged
cliff rising high behind and above it.
</p>

<p>
"Isn't it perfectly lovely?" said Mary, who
had never seen Hailey Compton before.
</p>

<p>
She had got over her first fear of the steepness
of the descent. Sir Evelyn, sitting beside
her in the back of the car, was still too nervous
to join in admiration of the scenery.
</p>

<p>
"I do wish he'd be more cautious," was all
he could say.
</p>

<p>
Jimmy, guided by Beth, swept along the
village street, charged the short hill to the
vicarage gate and pulled up before the door.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Eames rushed out to welcome them.
She kissed Beth vehemently, grasped Sir
Evelyn's hand and shook it with affectionate
violence, was introduced to Mary, and kissed
her, was introduced to Jimmy and looked for
a moment as if she meant to kiss him.
</p>

<p>
"You'll lunch with us, of course," she said.
"I'm so sorry Timothy isn't here, Sir Evelyn,
and he won't be back for lunch I'm afraid,
unless I send for him. But I will send for
him. Gladys shall go. He's up in the church."
</p>

<p>
"Still?" said Sir Evelyn.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_189' name='Page_189'>[189]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
He was a little surprised. Mr. Eames had
retired to the church three weeks before. It
seemed scarcely possible that he had been
there ever since.
</p>

<p>
"Your poor dear uncle," said Mrs. Eames to
Beth, "is more tiresome than I've ever known
him before. Not that I want to say a word
against him. He's a darling, but it is tiresome
of him to spend all of every day in the church.
I never see him except at night, and do you
know what I found out yesterday? He's taken
a spade and a pickaxe up there with him. At
least, if he hasn't taken them I don't know
what's happened to them. I can't find them.
The man who does the garden wanted the
spade yesterday, and while he was looking for
it he found that the pickaxe was gone too. So
annoying."
</p>

<p>
"Couldn't be digging graves, could he?"
said Jimmy not very helpfully.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no," said Mrs. Eames. "Poor Timothy
never does anything as useful as that. You
wouldn't think it of him if you knew him, Lord
Colavon, and of course it may not be he who
has taken the spade. I only said he had

because I can't think of anyone else who would
take it. But what would he want a pickaxe
for inside the church? And he never comes
out. He just sits there all day, reading Greek,
you know."
</p>

<p>
Sir Evelyn, though he did not say so, was of
opinion that the vicar must have gone mad.
St. Paul, who also seems to have read Greek
books, was suspected of having been driven
insane through much learning. Something of
the sort might have happened to Mr. Eames;
but Sir Evelyn was more inclined to lay the
blame on Mrs. Eames. He thought it likely
that he would be mad too if he had been
married to her.
</p>

<p>
"So you're really an actress," said Mrs.
Eames, turning abruptly to Mary. "You did
say she was a real actress, didn't you, Beth?
Isn't that lucky? You must know all about
pageants, if you're an actress, and you'll be
able to help us. I do want someone to help.
You'll come and stay with us till the pageant's
over, won't you? You can have Beth's room.
Or if Beth comes too, you can share it. You'll
come, won't you, Beth?"
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_191' name='Page_191'>[191]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Miss Lambert and Miss Appleby," said Sir
Evelyn, "have kindly consented to stay with
me till the play is over."
</p>

<p>
"Quite right," said Mrs. Eames cheerfully.
"They'll be far more comfortable with you.
I'd love to have them both. You know that,
Beth. But&mdash;well, you know what Gladys is
like."
</p>

<p>
"But of course I'll help," said Mary. "I'll
come over every day."
</p>

<p>
"How splendid. We'll have a rehearsal this
afternoon. Gladys shall run round the village
and tell the people. She'll like doing that far better
than cooking lunch. I'm afraid there isn't
very much for lunch. You see, I haven't been
having regular meals since poor dear Timothy
took to living in the church. But we might
have pancakes. You like pancakes, don't you,
Sir Evelyn?"
</p>

<p>
"We shouldn't dream of trespassing on your
kindness, Mrs. Eames," said Sir Evelyn. "We
brought our own luncheon with us."
</p>

<p>
"So if you'll just lend us knives and forks,
Aunt Agatha," said Beth.
</p>

<p>
Many women, slaves to conventionality,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_192' name='Page_192'>[192]</a></span>
would have been vexed to think that guests,
arriving at luncheon time, had brought their
own food with them. Mrs. Eames was not even
ruffled.
</p>

<p>
"But you must have pancakes too," she
said, "and scrambled eggs. I'm rather good
at scrambled eggs. And luckily the hens are
all laying just now. Generally they do nothing
but go broody at this time of year. It may
have been excitement about the pageant which
kept them from sitting. Not that they understand
what's happening, poor things, but excitement
gets into the air. So we can have
pancakes and scrambled eggs. I know you
like scrambled eggs, Sir Evelyn."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, greatly," said Sir Evelyn. "But I
really wish you wouldn't take so much trouble."
</p>

<p>
"It won't be any trouble," said Mrs. Eames.
"Gladys's aunt is nearly sure to be in the
kitchen, and if so she can make the pancakes.
Gladys can't or won't or both. I wish I could
offer you an omelette. Beth, dear, can you
make omelettes?"
</p>

<p>
"I can," said Mary Lambert. "At least I
think I can. Do let me try."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_193' name='Page_193'>[193]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"I used to think I could," said Mrs. Eames,
"and sometimes I can, but not always. In
fact generally my omelettes turn out to be
scrambled eggs. That's why I think it's better
to say scrambled eggs at once. Then if they
do happen to be omelettes it's a pleasant surprise,
whereas if I said omelettes and then produced
scrambled eggs Timothy might be disappointed.
Come along, Mary dear. You won't mind my
calling you Mary, will you. It's so stiff to go
on saying Miss Lambert when we're going to
make an omelette together. You can get out
the plates and lay the table, Beth. You'll find
a table cloth somewhere. I'm sure Sir Evelyn
would like a table cloth and I have several if
only they're clean. The fact is, I never have
a table cloth when Timothy isn't here. I
know I ought to. So bad for Gladys when I
don't."
</p>

<p>
She took Mary by the arm and led her off to
the kitchen.
</p>

<p>
"I think," said Beth, "that I'd better go
and look for the table cloth."
</p>

<p>
"Wait one moment," said Jimmy, "till I
get the luncheon basket out of the car and then
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_194' name='Page_194'>[194]</a></span>
I'll be with you. I feel sure it'll take two of us
to find that table cloth."
</p>

<p>
"Am I to be left alone?" said Sir Evelyn.
"I don't like it. If Mrs. Eames comes back
and finds me unprotected&mdash;&mdash; Perhaps the
best thing for me to do would be to join the
vicar in the church. Do you suppose he took
the pickaxe as a weapon of defence? I feel
as if I should like something of the sort."
</p>

<p>
"Your aunt," said Jimmy, a few minutes
later, "is perfectly priceless."
</p>

<p>
They were searching in the dining-room for
the table cloth and so far had not come on a
trace of it.
</p>

<p>
"There's a lot of go about her," said Beth.
</p>

<p>
"Go! I should think there was. I only
wish there was half as much in the Pallas Athene.
I wonder now, if I asked her very nicely, would
she come over to Morriton St. James some day
and take a look at that car. If anyone could
get a move on the wretched thing it would be
your aunt. She'd make anything in the world
hop up and run about."

</p>

<h2>Chapter XIV</h2>

<p>
The rehearsal in the afternoon was a success,
though tiring to all who took part in it.
</p>

<p>
Gladys, useless as housemaid or cook, showed
that there was something she could do really
well when she was turned into a messenger.
Released quite unexpectedly from duties she
detested, she sped joyfully round the village,
summoning performers to the mouth of the
cave at three o'clock. Her excited account of
the ladies and gentlemen who had come from
London to organise the pageant, roused fresh
interest in an affair which the people were
beginning to find a little tiresome.
</p>

<p>
Gladys did more than summon the performers.
She summoned everyone else too, insisting that
the whole village should turn out. She even
gave, in the name of the vicar, a totally unauthorised
order to the schoolmaster that the
children should be released an hour before the
proper time. The schoolmaster knew quite
well that the vicar had sent no such message;
and would have acted without authority if he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_196' name='Page_196'>[196]</a></span>
had; but he wanted to see the rehearsal himself,
so he pretended to believe Gladys. In this
he showed not only self-indulgence but wisdom.
It was doubtful whether he could have kept the
children in school if he had wanted to.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Eames's arrangements had been carefully
made, and the great scene thoroughly
thought out. Old Bunce's boat, representing the
lugger, lay a hundred yards off the mouth of the
cave. At the oars sat eight of the steadiest and
most reliable men in the village, chosen to be
the crew of the lugger on the day of the performance.
With these men there was no trouble
at all. They took the business seriously and
were ready to do exactly as Mrs. Eames bade
them. They sat, over their outstretched oars,
ready to pull to the shore the moment the signal
was given.
</p>

<p>
Tommy Whittle and his mentally deficient
brother were the signallers. At the actual
performance they were to light a flare on top of
the church tower. At rehearsal they merely
waved a flag from the churchyard wall. The
lighting of flares in broad daylight would have
been foolishly wasteful, and they could not get
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_197' name='Page_197'>[197]</a></span>
into the tower, even for purposes of rehearsal,
because the vicar kept all the church doors
locked. Their part was clear, and Tommy
thoroughly understood it. His brother, in
spite of his feebleness of mind, was quite capable
of doing what he was told. Indeed he was
more likely to obey orders literally and swiftly
than a man who could think for himself; which
shows that it is a mistake to develop the intelligence
of soldiers, trade unionists, the rank
and file of political parties, and others who
depend on discipline for their efficiency.
</p>

<p>
On the green beside the boat haven, where
the nets were dried and the geese paraded, it
was arranged that eight pack horses should
stand ready to be loaded with smuggled goods.
Each horse was to be in charge of two girls.
This was perhaps not strictly in accordance
with historical precedent, but Mrs. Eames felt
that some female parts were required and the
holding of the heads of pack horses seemed the
most suitable thing for girls to do. Only one
horse could be secured for the rehearsals, so
the sixteen girls took it in turn to hold the
creature.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_198' name='Page_198'>[198]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
On the occasion of the great rehearsal summoned
by Gladys the whole sixteen girls turned
out and argued fiercely, each pair alleging that
it was their turn to hold the horse. Mrs. Eames's
first duty, when she came down with her party
from the vicarage, was to settle this dispute, a
very difficult thing, for the mothers of the girls
were all there eager to support their daughters'
cause. This made a total of twenty-eight
women (four mothers had two daughters each),
who all talked at once and loudly. Perhaps
only Mrs. Eames among living Englishwomen
could have talked down so many competitors.
The horse itself, an elderly wise beast, strolled
about the green, nibbling at the grass. It
would have been there when wanted even if
no girl had held its head. Village maidens,
when intent on claiming their rights, are voluble.
Their mothers, having had more practice, talk
even more and faster. All, mothers and
daughters, talked at once. Sir Evelyn, who
walked with Mrs. Eames at the head of the
party from the vicarage, looked hopelessly at
the turmoil. Jimmy and the two girls stopped
at the edge of the green, waiting to see how
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_199' name='Page_199'>[199]</a></span>
Mrs. Eames would deal with the situation. Her
plan was simple. She talked faster, louder and
with shorter pauses for breath than anyone
else. One by one the girls were battered into
silence by a hailstorm of words. One by one
their mothers gave up the unequal contest.
Then Mrs. Eames selected two girls to hold the
horse, and, by way of compensation for disappointment,
promised that a little later Mary
Lambert would teach them all the proper way
to do it, the way proper to the occasion, the
way horses are held on the stage.
</p>

<p>
"Miss Lambert," said Mrs. Eames, "is a
real actress, and she knows all about pageants
and exactly how things ought to be done. As
soon as the rehearsal is over you shall all come
back here and she'll show you."
</p>

<p>
Mary Lambert had never held a horse in her
life on or off the stage. She said so to Mrs.
Eames in an appealing whisper.
</p>

<p>
"Or if she doesn't teach you that," said Mrs.
Eames, "she'll teach you something else quite
as nice. But you must keep quiet now and
let me get on with the rehearsal. What will
you teach them, Mary?"
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_200' name='Page_200'>[200]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"I'll teach them to dance," she said. "I'll
teach them my Nautch Girl dance. It's tremendously
fetching and they'll be able to learn
their part quite easily. You'll be able to fit
it in somewhere, won't you, Mrs. Eames?"
</p>

<p>
Sir Evelyn protested feebly against a Nautch
Girl dance in a pageant of eighteenth century
English life; but he was not allowed to say
very much. Mrs. Eames welcomed the proposal
and explained just where and when the
dance could take place.
</p>

<p>
That settled the trouble on the green; but
worse trouble waited at the mouth of the cave.
</p>

<p>
All children have an instinct which enables
them to know with certainty when they will be
most troublesome to their elders, and a desire,
which they make no effort to suppress, to collect
together in just that place. The Hailey Compton
school children, who might have found
amusement in helping their elder sisters to hold
the horse or in watching the Whittles waving
the signal flag, preferred to gather at the mouth
of the cave. Having unexpectedly escaped
from school they were full of vitality and spirits.
The whole sixty of them ran rapidly to and fro
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_201' name='Page_201'>[201]</a></span>
in different directions, leaped from rock to rock
with shouts of joy, and often fell, the tumbles
being followed by cries of pain.
</p>

<p>
Besides the children there were some thirty
or forty village people who had no part in the
pageant gathered at the mouth of the cave.
Their number was increased by the arrival of
the fourteen girls who had been told not to hold
the horse, and the whole twelve mothers. Mrs.
Eames had to deal with them as well as with
the children.
</p>

<p>
Her difficulties were increased by young Jim
Bunce, son of the man chosen to be captain of
the lugger. He had been given the part of
leader of the men on shore who landed the
cargo. He had lost a complicated arrangement
of ropes and pulleys which he called a tackle.
This was a valuable, according to his account
an indispensable, stage property. Nothing, so
he said, could be done unless the tackle was
found.
</p>

<p>
"How are us to unload the boat without we
have a tackle?" he asked, and kept on asking
in a steady, emotionless monotone.
</p>

<p>
He regarded Mrs. Eames as responsible for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_202' name='Page_202'>[202]</a></span>
the tackle, blamed her for the loss and seemed
to take it for granted that she either knew where
the thing was or possessed some means of finding
it out. He did not actually say so, but his
tone implied that if the rehearsal and the final
performance broke down, as they would unless
the tackle was found, Mrs. Eames would have
no one to blame except herself. He had a
statement which he made repeatedly and very
slowly about the loss. After the last rehearsal
he had left the tackle coiled up and in good
order on top of a rock far above high-water mark
just inside the cave. From that rock it had
disappeared. This must have been true, for
he repeated it at least twenty times without the
smallest variation of detail.
</p>

<p>
While Mrs. Eames appealed to the unwanted
people to go away, Jimmy Bunce appealed to
her to find his tackle. While she pursued flying
children he followed her. When she caught a
child he caught her and repeated his statement.
When she paused breathless after vain pursuit
of a swift child, Jimmy Bunce was at her side.
Sometimes he attributed the loss of the tackle
to evilly disposed people inspired by the devil
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_203' name='Page_203'>[203]</a></span>
who had entered into them. Sometimes he
seemed to think that the devil had acted personally
in the matter, without using human
agency. But&mdash;whether man or devil were the
culprit&mdash;he held that Mrs. Eames was responsible.
</p>

<p>
She ought to have managed somehow to bring
to naught the evil that the craft and subtlety
of the devil or man had worked against Jimmy
Bunce. If she had not done or could not do
that, then the vicar, so Jimmy hinted, ought to
give up saying the Litany.
</p>

<p>
Gladys managed to add a little to Mrs. Eames's
difficulties. She had been given a responsible
and important job to do. The signallers,
Whittle and his brothers, could not see how
the preparations for landing were getting on,
because the churchyard wall, where they were
stationed, was just above the mouth of the
cave. Someone had to run off to the end of
the beach and tell them when all was ready for
the signal to be given. Gladys undertook to
do this and promised to stand waving her arms
in full view of the Whittles when the time came
for the arrival of the boat. She was eager and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_204' name='Page_204'>[204]</a></span>
excited, so eager and excited that she ran after
Mrs. Eames wherever she went, asking whether
her time of action had yet come.
</p>

<p>
Mary Lambert viewed the scene with professional
calm. She was accustomed to a
certain amount of confusion at early rehearsals
and felt confident that things would settle
down at the end. In the meantime she caught
Mrs. Eames whenever she could and asked intelligent
and important questions. "Where," for
instance, "would the spectators be on the
day of the performance?" "Where would
the orchestra be placed?" "What kind of
platform would be provided for the Nautch
Girl dance?"
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Eames, one of those fortunate people
who enjoy fuss, replied to her as she replied to
Jimmy Bunce and Gladys, without a sign of
irritation, though sometimes a little hurriedly.
</p>

<p>
Sir Evelyn was gloomy. It did not seem to
him possible that order would ever be achieved
or the rehearsal be done. He asked himself,
not for the first time, whether he had not been a
fool to mix himself up with any undertaking
managed by a woman like Mrs. Eames. Foreseeing
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_205' name='Page_205'>[205]</a></span>
reproaches afterwards, he bitterly regretted
having asked his friends to be patrons
of the pageant. He sat on a rock with his back
to the turmoil and gazed out to sea. There, a
hundred yards or so from the shore, lay Bunce's
laden boat. The crew sat bent over their outstretched
oars, calm and indifferent to the
passing of time. Now and then when the
rising tide carried their boat eastward, they
dipped their oars, and with quiet, effortless
motion regained their position off the mouth
of the cave. Sir Evelyn, smoking cigarette
after cigarette, marvelled at a patience which
he could not hope to imitate.
</p>

<p>
Young Bunce left Mrs. Eames for a while and
fastened on Sir Evelyn. He was not an Ancient
Mariner, and his eye was more fishy than
glittering, but he held his auditor as firmly as
Coleridge's hero held his. The tale of the
lost tackle was not so long as that of the lost
ship, but Sir Evelyn had to listen to it three
times and always with the feeling&mdash;successfully
conveyed also to Mrs. Eames&mdash;that he was to
blame for the disaster. Sir Evelyn tried the
plan constantly adopted by worried men. An
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_206' name='Page_206'>[206]</a></span>
Anglo-Saxon king gave Dane Gelt to the invaders
of the land. Modern statesmen give
increasing doles to the insurgent proletariat.
Sir Evelyn gave young Bunce ten shillings with
which to buy another tackle. Bunce accepted
the money, explaining as he did so that tackles
are made and not bought and that it would
take at least a week to achieve a new one. But
the ten shillings was not wasted. Unlike the
ancient Dane Gelt and the modern dole, it
achieved its object. Jimmy Bunce went away.
He feared that if he stayed he might be forced
to give the money back. Although tackles
cannot be bought other things can, and young
Bunce wanted to keep the money if he could.
</p>

<p>
"Beth," said Jimmy, "I'm almost fed up
with this."
</p>

<p>
They had been watching Mrs. Eames's efforts
to get her company together and to clear the
stage of superfluous people. They had even
tried to help her. When it became clear that
they were doing more harm than good they
stood on a rock above the tumult and watched
again. It was after ten minutes of this second
watching that Jimmy became bored.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_207' name='Page_207'>[207]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Let's toddle off somewhere," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Where?" said Beth. "Back to the
vicarage?"
</p>

<p>
"I suppose," said Jimmy, "that there's no
chance of raising a couple of cocktails anywhere?"
</p>

<p>
"There's James Hinton's pub. But&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"No go. Hinton would manage it if he was
there. Not a fellow in England is better at
dry Martinis than Hinton. But he's not there.
He's probably buying a dress shirt for me and
a ready-made dinner jacket from his friend
Linker, so we may regard the cocktails as
off."
</p>

<p>
"Would you care to look at the church?"
</p>

<p>
"No. Why should I?"
</p>

<p>
"People generally do in strange places,"
said Beth. "It's one of the things that's
always done."
</p>

<p>
"Can't think why. I hate churches myself."
</p>

<p>
"So do I." said Beth; "but there's
nothing else to see in Hailey Compton except&mdash;&mdash;
What about exploring the cave?"
</p>

<p>
"Is there anything to explore?"
</p>

<p>
"It's supposed to go miles and miles inland,"
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_208' name='Page_208'>[208]</a></span>
said Beth, "and nobody's ever been to the end
of it. They say it's haunted."
</p>

<p>
"Ghosts of dead smugglers! Let's go and
find one."
</p>

<p>
"There won't be any if I go," said Beth.
"Nothing spooky ever comes off when I'm
there. I've tried lots of times. Spiritualist
séances and so on. The beastly things work
all right, so I'm told, till I come, but then they
simply dry up."
</p>

<p>
"I'm not particularly spooky myself," said
Jimmy, "but we might try. Hunting the
elusive ghost would be better than standing
here, even if we don't run one to earth."
</p>

<p>
They climbed down from their rock and
pushed their way among the groups of pageant
actors, unwanted spectators, and children who
were beginning to tire of running about. They
scrambled over a ridge of sharp rocks and
dropped on to a broad track covered, like the
beach outside, with round white stones. The
sound of the voices behind them grew fainter.
Even Mrs. Eames's voice died away. Their
steps upon the rolling stones made a hollow,
growling sound which reverberated from the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_209' name='Page_209'>[209]</a></span>
walls and roof of the cave, multiplied and increased
in volume.
</p>

<p>
The light grew feebler as they went on. They
felt, rather than saw, that they were ascending
steeply. But the roof of the cave was still remotely
high, only dimly discernible in the
gloom, and the walls were still far apart. There
were no signs of coming to the end.
</p>

<p>
Beth turned and looked round. The sea
and sky were like a picture in a frame, very
distant, incredibly bright. Bunce's boat, the
crew still crouched over their oars, was plainly
to be seen. The moving figures at the entrance
to the cave were silhouetted black
outlines against the background of sea and
sky. Beth, in a voice which sounded strangely
deep, called Jimmy to look.
</p>

<p>
After that they saw the world outside no
more. The cave bent to the right. The light
got feebler, so dim that now and then Jimmy
had to strike matches in order to be able to see
what was before them. It was plain at last
that the walls were closing in, that the way
was narrowed and the roof lower than it had
been.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_210' name='Page_210'>[210]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Getting near the end," said Jimmy. "If
we're to come on a ghost of any sort it must be
now or never."
</p>

<h2>Chapter XV</h2>

<p>
"Listen," said Beth suddenly.
</p>

<p>
She spoke in a gasp, the toneless whisper of
someone who is frightened.
</p>

<p>
From far above them came sounds, sometimes
of light tapping, sometimes as if a man were
scraping at the roof of the cave. Jimmy
struck another match, one of the last left in his
box, and held it out in front of him. They
had reached the end of the cave. The roof
above them descended sharply and met a wall
of solid rock through which there was no
possibility of passing. But in the roof there
was a hole. The match held aloft revealed
it, very black, wide as the chimneys of the fireplaces
to be found in old houses. It was from
the hole that the sounds of tapping and scraping
came.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly from very far up came a new sound,
a distant rattling. It increased and drew
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_211' name='Page_211'>[211]</a></span>
nearer. A large stone, striking the sides of the
chimney sharply as it descended, crashed at
their feet and was shattered into atoms.
</p>

<p>
Such a thing was alarming enough without
any suggestion of the supernatural about it.
The force with which the stone struck the ground
showed that it had fallen from a considerable
height. Jimmy seized Beth by the arm and
pulled her to one side of the cave, out of reach
of other stones which might come crashing
down.
</p>

<p>
"Oh," gasped Beth, "what is it?"
</p>

<p>
"Sounds rather like a smuggler's ghost pelting
us," said Jimmy. "A damned dangerous
thing to do in a place like this without shouting
'Heads' or 'Fore' or any kind of warning."
</p>

<p>
"Jimmy," said Beth, "I'm terrified."
</p>

<p>
She was experiencing for the first time in her
life a kind of fear which she had often laughed
at. It is easy enough to be cheerfully sceptical
about ghosts in broad daylight and among
familiar things, or to boast of immunity from
spookiness when nothing unusual is happening.
It is quite another matter when stones take to
falling out of a black unknown into a narrow,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_212' name='Page_212'>[212]</a></span>
gloomy place, where every movement and every
word make hollow sounds, horribly suggestive
of infernal things, when the terrifying crash
echoes from rocks on the right, on the left and
above, when there is no way of accounting for
such happenings. Then cheery scepticism is
likely to be chased away by awe. Beth was a
prey to the kind of fear in which investigators
of the occult find a painful delight, an excruciating
ecstasy, which, in apologising to the rest of
us, the experimenters call scientific curiosity.
</p>

<p>
She clung tight to Jimmy's arm with both
hands.
</p>

<p>
For a minute or two they stood waiting and
listening. No more stones dropped down the
chimney. The noise of tapping and scratching
which they had heard ceased. There was
complete silence, as dull and heavy as the atmosphere
of the cave. It was Jimmy who broke
it. He had been puzzled by the noise above
him and startled by the falling stone, but he
had not felt the fear of the supernatural which
had swept over Beth. When he spoke it was
in a tone very reassuring to the girl who clung
to him.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_213' name='Page_213'>[213]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Futile sort of old ghost," he said. "I don't
call one stone much of a demonstration, do
you?"
</p>

<p>
"But," said Beth, who was recovering her
self-possession, "it wasn't really a ghost. I
mean to say, it couldn't have been. But what
was it? Who dropped the stone?"
</p>

<p>
"If you ask me, I'm inclined to think&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
There he stopped abruptly. The noises of
tapping and scraping had begun again. Tap,
tap, tap, far up above their heads, and then a
crunching sound. It was as if someone at a
considerable distance was striking with a pickaxe
and shovelling up loose earth. Jimmy
listened intently.
</p>

<p>
"If you ask me," he repeated, "I'm inclined
to think that somebody is trying to
knock a hole in the roof of this cave. What's
above us here, Beth?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know," said Beth. "The cliff, I
suppose."
</p>

<p>
"Well, then, there's somebody on the top of
the cliff digging a hole. Can't imagine what
he wants to do such a thing for!"
</p>

<p>
He struck a match and looked up. The hole,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_214' name='Page_214'>[214]</a></span>
a large space of inky blackness, was some six
feet from the ground. It was wide and the
rocks at its side were jagged.
</p>

<p>
"If I could get a grip on that craggy bit that
is sticking out," said Jimmy, "I could pull
myself up into the hole. It's probably easy
enough climbing after that. Just stand clear
for a minute while I jump. I'll have a try at
it."
</p>

<p>
But Beth was not inclined to let him try.
Instead of standing clear she clung to him more
tightly than before.
</p>

<p>
"Don't do it, Jimmy," she said.
</p>

<p>
"Still nervous about the smuggler's ghost?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm not thinking about ghosts. Suppose
another stone came down when you were halfway
up that chimney?"
</p>

<p>
That was a real peril and Jimmy was obliged
to consider it. Jammed tight in what might
very well prove to be a narrow passage he would
be quite defenceless against a falling stone.
As if to emphasise the reality of the risk, there
came rumbling and clattering down the chimney
a shower of pebbles and loose earth. Beth
was startled again&mdash;so startled, that she loosed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_215' name='Page_215'>[215]</a></span>
her grasp round Jimmy's elbow and flung her
arms round his neck.
</p>

<p>
"Jimmy, dearest," she said, "you'll be killed
if you go."
</p>

<p>
It is very likely that he would have been
killed, for a small avalanche of stones, pebbles
and earth came rushing down. The loose
debris clattered and crashed on the floor of the
cave, some of the stones rolling up to Beth's
feet. Jimmy pulled her back still further from
the hole.
</p>

<p>
"Don't go, Jimmy," she said.
</p>

<p>
"All right. I won't. It's not good enough.
But I say, Beth&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Relieved of her fear for him and far enough
from the hole to feel safe herself, Beth realised
that she was clinging very close to Jimmy.
The position, though very pleasant for him,
was embarrassing for her. She drew away
quickly.
</p>

<p>
"I say, Beth," said Jimmy, "don't do that.
What I mean to say is, go on doing that. Don't
you think you ought to?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm quite sure I ought not. I can't think
how I came to do it."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_216' name='Page_216'>[216]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"If I say I'm going up the hole, you might
do it again. Would you?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly not."
</p>

<p>
"But when we're married," said Jimmy,
"you'll more or less have to. I mean to say, it's
the regular thing then. So I've always understood.
And as we're engaged to be married
now&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"We're not."
</p>

<p>
"Well, as good as engaged."
</p>

<p>
"We're not as good as engaged. I've told
you that a dozen times at least, Jimmy. The
most that I ever said was that we might be
some time or other."
</p>

<p>
"Can't see why not now," said Jimmy.
"Here we are facing unknown dangers together,
practically in the dark, and I've only one match
left, pelted with stones by the ghosts of desperate
smugglers, lost in the depths of a cavern
measureless to man. If you won't agree to
marry me now, Beth, I don't see how you ever
will. It's a priceless opportunity. In all the
novels I've ever read the heroine's maidenly
resistance invariably collapses in the hour of
peril&mdash;far less peril than ours, generally only a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_217' name='Page_217'>[217]</a></span>
lion or a painted savage, absolutely nothing
to a vengeful ghost."
</p>

<p>
"Jimmy, dear, don't be silly. I'm still a
little frightened. Let's get out of this."
</p>

<p>
"If you're unmoved by the romance of the
situation, though I don't see how anyone can
be&mdash;&mdash; I say, just listen to that." The remote
digger was apparently working harder than
ever. The blows of iron on stone sounded clear
and frequent. "How can you refuse to fall
into the arms of your lover when a ghost is
digging his own grave a few feet above your
head?"
</p>

<p>
"Do talk sense, Jimmy, and take me out of
this."
</p>

<p>
"I will. I'll do both. Talk sense first and
then take you away. Uncle Evie was at me
last night about you."
</p>

<p>
"About me?"
</p>

<p>
"Asking me why the deuce I didn't marry
you."
</p>

<p>
"Is that what you call talking sense? Sir
Evelyn couldn't have said that?"
</p>

<p>
"He did. He put it to me at the point of
the bayonet. I can't remember his exact words,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_218' name='Page_218'>[218]</a></span>
but what they amounted to was this: If I
didn't marry you, he would. Now what do
you say to that?"
</p>

<p>
"I say that you've got an extraordinarily
inventive mind. Also that you oughtn't to
tell lies about your uncle."
</p>

<p>
"It's not a lie," said Jimmy, "though I
admit it's not the whole truth. The suggestion
was that I should marry either you or Mary and
that he'd marry the other, or rather that he'd
marry one of you and I'd marry the other. I
give you my solemn word of honour that that's
what passed between us last night after you'd
gone to bed."
</p>

<p>
"You give me your solemn word of honour
that Sir Evelyn suggested&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"As a matter of actual fact," said Jimmy,
"the suggestion came from me. But Uncle
Evie quite fell in with it. Quite. He hadn't
a word to say against it."
</p>

<p>
"Very well," said Beth, "I'll marry your
Uncle Evie as soon as he asks me, and then
you can marry Mary if she'll have you, which
she probably won't. So now that's settled."
</p>

<p>
"Very well. I'll give you a wedding present
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_219' name='Page_219'>[219]</a></span>
and all that. But now what about marrying
me after Uncle Evie dies? I don't want him to
die, for he's always been very decent to me.
Still, nobody lives for ever, and he's well over
sixty. What do you say to that?"
</p>

<p>
"If I'm ever left a widow and you're a
widower about the same time&mdash;don't forget
you promised to marry Mary&mdash;I'll marry you.
Will that satisfy you?"
</p>

<p>
"It doesn't in the least. But I suppose it's
as much as I'll get out of you to-day."
</p>

<p>
"You won't get even that unless you take
me out of this beastly cave where I'm smothering
for want of air and terrified out of my
senses."
</p>

<p>
They stumbled back together to the bend in
the cave from which it was possible to see the
sunlight. Beth drew a deep breath of relief and
hurried forward, as fast as it was possible to
hurry over a track of round, rolling stones.
</p>

<p>
"Don't rush so, Beth," said Jimmy. "I'm
out of breath, and there's something I want to
say to you."
</p>

<p>
"If it's anything more about my marrying
your uncle," said Beth, "I won't listen to it."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_220' name='Page_220'>[220]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"It's not. It's something more about your
marrying me."
</p>

<p>
They had reached the mouth of the cave.
The rehearsal, well started at last, was going on
in a serious and orderly way. Old Bunce's
boat had reached the pool and was made fast
to the rocks. Her cargo was being landed.
Mrs. Eames shouted orders from the top of the
rock off which she had dived on the day when
Sir Evelyn first met her. The superfluous
people and all the children were herded together
under the charge of Mary Lambert, who prevented
their interfering with the performance.
Sir Evelyn, perched somewhat perilously beside
Mrs. Eames, was looking on with satisfaction.
Everybody was too busy and too deeply interested
to take any notice of Beth and Jimmy
when they came from the depths of the cave.
</p>

<p>
"Beth," said Jimmy, "I'm quite serious
this time."
</p>

<p>
"So am I," said Beth. "I like you, Jimmy.
I've always liked you; but I'm not going to
marry a man who&mdash;&mdash; But I've told you all
that a dozen times."
</p>

<p>
"You have," said Jimmy, "and I quite see
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_221' name='Page_221'>[221]</a></span>
your point. I'm a rotter, a footering butterfly,
perching on the flowers of life instead of gathering
honey like a good, laborious bee. I don't
go in for work and all that sort of piffle. That's
it, isn't it, Beth? That's what you say."
</p>

<p>
"Look at Aunt Agatha," said Beth, "married
to a man who doesn't do anything, who just
sits and moons and dreams."
</p>

<p>
"Hang it all, Beth, you can't think I'd spend
my life shut up in a church if you married me.
I'm not that sort at all."
</p>

<p>
"You'd spend your life playing about with
motor-cars and things," she said. "And,
Jimmy, dear, can't you see that I couldn't bear
to be married to a man who didn't do anything?"
</p>

<p>
"I quite grasp that," said Jimmy.
</p>

<p>
"Then why go on worrying me? For it
does worry me."
</p>

<p>
"I'm not going to worry you, Beth. What
I want to do is to propose&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I won't be proposed to again to-day."
</p>

<p>
"I'm not going to propose in that sense of
the word," said Jimmy. "I'm going to make
a proposition. Suppose I go off now and unearth
that smuggler's ghost, find out what he's
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_222' name='Page_222'>[222]</a></span>
at and why. Would you count that doing
something? Something useful? Hang it all,
Beth, I think you ought to. The old knights
and fellows of that sort who went about killing
dragons and giants were looked upon as most
valuable members of society and the most conscientious
girls were delighted to marry them.
If I get rid of a ghost&mdash;&mdash; You may say what
you like, Beth, but a ghost in a small village is
a regular pest, much worse than most dragons.
If I collar the malignant spirit of that smuggler
and stop him throwing stones it'll be something
done, won't it? A jolly sight more useful thing
really than being chairman of a committee for
infant welfare, which is the sort of thing you
think I ought to do. If I smother that ghost,
Beth, will you marry me?"
</p>

<p>
"I'll&mdash;I'll think about it, Jimmy."
</p>

<h2>Chapter XIV</h2>

<p>
"Very well," said Jimmy, "come up to the
church."
</p>

<p>
"The church?"
</p>

<p>
"You suggested going to the church before
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_223' name='Page_223'>[223]</a></span>
we explored the cave. What's wrong about
going there now?"
</p>

<p>
"But what do you want to go to the church
for? You said you hated churches."
</p>

<p>
"The mediæval knight," said Jimmy, "always
went to church before he set out to slay
dragons. He generally spent a whole day there,
consecrating his sword and that sort of thing.
Come on."
</p>

<p>
"I won't go to the church with you if you're
going to do anything profane or make jokes
about religion."
</p>

<p>
"I'm going to discover a ghost," said Jimmy.
"You can't call that profane."
</p>

<p>
They passed through the middle of the rehearsal.
Mrs. Eames shouted at them entreating
them to stop and give advice about
the proper way of handling kegs supposed to
contain French brandy. Sir Evelyn descended
from his perch and wanted to start a discussion
about the rigging of the lugger. Jimmy took
no notice of either of them. He waved his hand
cheerfully to Mrs. Eames, and when his uncle
caught him by the sleeve scarcely allowed
himself to be stopped.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_224' name='Page_224'>[224]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Later on," he said. "I'll go into all that
in an hour or so. Just at present I can't. I'm
frightfully busy. I've a most pressing engagement.
The whole future of the pageant depends
on my keeping it. Come on, Beth."
</p>

<p>
They crossed the beach and reached the
green. There they were approached by the
two girls who had been left in charge of the
horse. Earlier in the day they had been eager
enough to be allowed to hold it. Now they were
thoroughly tired of the job, and felt that they
were missing all the fun that was going on at the
mouth of the cave. They wanted to be released.
</p>

<p>
"Certainly not," said Jimmy. "Life isn't
all fun. You ask this lady," he pointed to Beth,
"and she'll tell you that the great thing is to
be real and earnest and doing some jolly useful
kind of work, holding a horse, for instance, or
chasing ghosts or anything of that sort which
is really hard work and is done for the sake of
others. That's it, isn't it, Beth?"
</p>

<p>
Beth looked at the girls who wanted to be off
and hated holding the horse. She looked at
the horse, which also wanted to be off and hated
being held.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_225' name='Page_225'>[225]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"I really think," she said, "that Aunt
Agatha wouldn't mind if they went away."
</p>

<p>
"Beastly inconsistent of you, Beth," said
Jimmy. "I think you ought to tell those girls
what you're always telling me. I mean about
getting married. Now, listen to me, Millicent
Pamela. And you, Gwendoline Irene&mdash;those
are your names, I suppose."
</p>

<p>
The girls grinned shamefacedly. With an
instinctive knowledge of the taste of village
people he had got the girls' names very nearly
right. One of them was Auriole Millicent and
the other Eunice Gwendoline.
</p>

<p>
"The lady says that if you don't slay dragons
or hold that horse or chase a ghost or do something
like that, no nice man will ever marry you.
That's it, isn't it, Beth?"
</p>

<p>
But the girls did not wait to hear what Beth
had to say. They were prepared to sacrifice
their chance of getting husbands rather than
miss the gathering at the mouth of the cave.
</p>

<p>
Beth and Jimmy climbed the steep path
which led to the church. The two Whittles,
their flag signalling accomplished, had gone
away. Jimmy walked slowly round the churchyard
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_226' name='Page_226'>[226]</a></span>
looking at the graves with some attention.
The tombstones were all in place and looked
as if they had not been disturbed for years.
Not a single grave had been recently opened.
</p>

<p>
"What are you doing?" said Beth.
</p>

<p>
"Looking for the ghost," said Jimmy, "who's
throwing stones through the roof of the
cave."
</p>

<p>
He climbed on the wall of the churchyard
and looked down, standing in the very spot
which had been occupied by the Whittles an
hour before. He saw the green, where the
horse, released from bondage, was grazing
quietly. He saw the stony beach. He saw the
face of the cliff beyond the cave. He peered
over and looked straight down. He turned and
looked at the cliff behind the church, a precipice
of rugged rock.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'm hanged," he said.
</p>

<p>
"What is the matter?" said Beth.
</p>

<p>
"I'm hanged if I thought that even the
ghost of a smuggler would have done it," he
said. "What lawless ruffians those fellows
were! But even so I'd have expected them
to have some regard for the church."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_227' name='Page_227'>[227]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"I don't know what you're talking about,"
said Beth.
</p>

<p>
"Well, you ought to know. And considering
it was you who drove me on to do it I don't see
how you can possibly not know."
</p>

<p>
"Drove you on to do what?"
</p>

<p>
"Find the ghost of the smuggler who's throwing
stones. He must have dug a hole somewhere
to throw them through, mustn't he? Even
a ghost can't throw stones through solid earth.
And he must have done it up here, for the
place is right over the cave. My idea was that
he was operating through a grave, his own very
likely, but he isn't. Nothing could be more
peacefully undisturbed than all these graves,
not a tombstone so much as knocked sideways.
Still there the facts are. Somebody is dropping
stones from somewhere into the chimney at
the end of the cave and if it isn't from a hole in
the graveyard it must be from inside the church.
The next thing is to go inside and look."
</p>

<p>
"But Uncle Timothy's there," said Beth,
"and if anybody was digging a hole in the
church he'd stop them."
</p>

<p>
"He might not. It all depends on who was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_228' name='Page_228'>[228]</a></span>
digging. Lots of people would hesitate to
interfere with the ghost of a smuggler."
</p>

<p>
The south door of the church was locked.
The small door which led into the vestry was
locked, too. The large west door under the
tower had not been opened for years. Loud
knocking on one door after the other brought
no answer.
</p>

<p>
"Uncle Timothy," said Beth, "must have
gone to sleep. I don't wonder. I expect
Aunt Agatha keeps him awake most of the night
telling him that he really ought to do something
for the parish."
</p>

<p>
"So he ought," said Jimmy. "I quite agree
with your aunt. I quite agree with you, too,
Beth, when you say that sort of thing. I wonder
if we could open a window and climb in."
</p>

<p>
"Church windows don't open," said Beth.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps some day they will, if the Modernists
get their way. Then all sorts of dangerous
draughts will blow the altar hangings about,
dissipate the smell of incense and dying flowers,
even disturb the heavy stuffiness of centuries
of ordered piety. In the meanwhile Beth was
right. Church windows are not made to open.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_229' name='Page_229'>[229]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Next to getting in, which appeared to be
impossible, the best thing was to look in. But
here again there were difficulties. Church windows
are set high in walls and cannot easily be
reached. But Jimmy was a young man of
great determination. He found a shed in a
corner of the churchyard. In it the sexton
kept a scythe, a mowing machine, some cans
and a bier, a four-wheeled vehicle with rubber
tyres. Jimmy wheeled it out and set it under
a window. Beth protested. She feared that
this use of a bier if not actually sacrilege was
an offence against decency. Jimmy climbed
up on the bier and peered through the window.
</p>

<p>
He had a clear view of the nave of the church.
He could peer down into the pews, could see the
pulpit, the font and the lectern. There was no
sign that the pavement or flooring had been
disturbed anywhere. Worshippers might have
entered, had in fact entered, three days before,
and sat in their accustomed seats and listened
to all that they expected to hear without being
struck by anything unusual in the condition of
their church.
</p>

<p>
Jimmy moved the bier to a window in the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_230' name='Page_230'>[230]</a></span>
chancel and climbed up on it again. He found
himself looking down into the high-sided square
pew, surrounded with curtains, which stood
close to the chancel rails. It had been set
apart a century before for the use of the lord
of the manor. It had been unoccupied for at
least fifty years by anyone, except the vicar,
when he used it as a study and sat in one of
the arm-chairs with the tattered carpet under
his feet, reading Epictetus.
</p>

<p>
When Jimmy looked down into it the arm-chairs
had been moved and piled into a corner.
The carpet had been rolled up. The flooring
had been removed. In a deep hole in the
middle of the pew he saw the back of the
Reverend Timothy Eames bent low over a
spade.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'm properly and completely damned,"
said Jimmy.
</p>

<p>
Beth was steadying the bier, which had a
tendency to run away whenever Jimmy moved.
She was very naturally shocked at the use of
this language by an unauthorised layman so
near the church. The position of the clergy is
quite different. They are actually commanded
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_231' name='Page_231'>[231]</a></span>
to say "damn" not only near but inside the
church.
</p>

<p>
"Jimmy dear," she said, "do you remember
where you are?"
</p>

<p>
"Get up here," he said, "and peep in. Then
you'll forget where you are and either say
'damn' or something worse."
</p>

<p>
He jumped down, upsetting the bier, a vehicle
not designed for the use of active passengers.
When it was on its four wheels again he helped
Beth on to it and she took her turn at peering
through the window.
</p>

<p>
"Good gracious!" she said. "It's Uncle
Timothy."
</p>

<p>
"There's a Lisping for that Lilith of yours
for next week," he said. "'The floor of a
parish church dug up by pious vicar.' Such a
thing has never been heard of before."
</p>

<p>
"Jimmy," she whispered, "do you think&mdash;&mdash;
I've heard that the clergy are often buried in
the chancels of churches, and he does have a
trying time sometimes with Aunt Agatha?
Do you think he can be digging his own grave?
Oh!"
</p>

<p>
The exclamation was forced from her by the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_232' name='Page_232'>[232]</a></span>
fact that the vicar, startled by some sound,
suddenly stood upright and stared at her.
Beth's nerves had already been shaken by the
noises and the falling stones in the cave. It
was small wonder that the sudden rising of her
uncle from what looked like a grave startled
her afresh.
</p>

<p>
The vicar was nearly as frightened as she
was. A face appearing at a church window
high up in the walls of a chancel is scarcely
likely to belong to a human being. In all
probability it is an angel, and though we
respect angels and like to sing hymns about
them we do not want to come into personal
contact with one. Their portraits are all very
well and can be comfortably admired when
painted on the glass of church windows. The
actual face pressed against the glass outside is
not such a pleasant thing to see.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Eames recovered his self-possession before
Beth regained hers. He recognised his
niece, and having recognised her was embarrassed
rather than frightened.
</p>

<p>
"My dear Beth," he shouted, for it is
necessary to shout if conversation is to be
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_233' name='Page_233'>[233]</a></span>
carried on through a stained glass window.
"I didn't expect to meet you here, but I'm
very glad, very glad indeed to see you. I'll
come out to you and then we can both go down
to the vicarage for tea. You're sure to want
tea. I know I do. To tell you the truth I
forgot to bring up any sandwiches to-day, so
I've had no lunch."
</p>

<p>
He rubbed a little of the clay off his hands,
laid the floor boards of the pew over the hole
and replaced the carpet. Then he unlocked
the south door of the church and greeted Beth.
She introduced Jimmy. The Vicar looked
first at one and then at the other with a whimsical
little smile.
</p>

<p>
"You young people have caught me," he
said. "But I hope&mdash;&mdash;it's rather a humiliating
request to make but I hope that you won't
find it necessary to tell anyone what I was
doing."
</p>

<p>
"As if we would, Uncle Timothy," said Beth.
"Especially Aunt Agatha."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes, especially your aunt. Of course
I'm going to tell her all about it in the end.
But the fact is&mdash;&mdash; You know, my dear Beth,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_234' name='Page_234'>[234]</a></span>
how your aunt is always telling me that I
ought to do something for the parish."
</p>

<p>
"Poor Uncle Timothy!" said Beth.
</p>

<p>
"She's quite right," said Mr. Eames mildly.
"I've always admitted that she's quite right.
A man ought not to live without doing something."
</p>

<p>
"That's exactly what Beth says to me,"
said Jimmy, "and she's quite right, too."
</p>

<p>
"My difficulty," said Mr. Eames, "was to
discover something which I could do, and at
the same time something that would please
your aunt. Now I think I've found the exact
thing."
</p>

<p>
"Uncle Timothy," said Beth, "I don't believe
Aunt Agatha is as bad as that. I know
she's really fond of you. She won't be pleased.
She really won't. She'll be very sorry, heartbroken,
when you tell her that you've dug your
grave."
</p>

<p>
"My grave! My dear Beth! Dug my
grave! But I haven't. Nothing of the sort."
</p>

<p>
"Then what on earth were you digging?"
said Beth.
</p>

<p>
"That," said the vicar, "is quite a long story."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_235' name='Page_235'>[235]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
It was; but he told it. Sitting on a flat
tombstone with Beth on the grass at his feet,
and Jimmy, fairly comfortable, full stretch on
the bier.
</p>

<p>
Years before, soon after coming to Hailey
Compton, the vicar had heard that there was
some connection between the church and the
cave. A legend existed, repeated without conviction
by the old people in the parish, that
the smugglers, in the irreverent days of the
eighteenth century, used to store their goods in
the church itself. But such stories are common
all over England. There is scarcely an ancient
church but rumour speaks of a covered way
between it and a cave or the ruins of a monastery
or a house which occupies the site of
what was once a baron's castle. There is at
least one church which tradition insists on
connecting with a neighbouring public-house.
If that passage could be found&mdash;and traces of
it were discovered lately by men engaged in
making a drain&mdash;it might be used as an argument
by temperance reformers to demonstrate
that an immoral alliance has always existed
between the church and the brewery. Or by
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_236' name='Page_236'>[236]</a></span>
the advocates of more and better beer, to
prove that the church, in the days when its
faith was still undefiled by Henry VIII and
Elizabeth, was not hostile to the natural joys
of life. Such is the peculiar value of arguments
based on historical and archæological research.
They can be used with equal force on either
side in any modern dispute.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Eames, knowing the untrustworthy
nature of local legends, paid no particular
attention to that which connected his church
with the smugglers' cave, and might never have
investigated the matter if he had not been
troubled by a loose board in the floor of the pew
to which he had retired to read Epictetus.
Day after day this board wobbled and shook
under the leg of his chair when he sat down.
He remembered the same thing happening
when he had retired to the church for a few days
during the starting of his wife's plays. Then,
since he did not stay long, the thing had not
mattered much. On the occasion of the pageant
it became a serious annoyance. It was no use
moving the chair, for wherever he put it one of
its legs stood on a loose board. It appeared
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_237' name='Page_237'>[237]</a></span>
that nearly all the boards in the floor of that
pew were loose.
</p>

<p>
Goaded to exasperation he at last took up
the well worn and exceedingly dirty carpet to
find out what was the matter with the boards.
He discovered to his amazement that they were
not only loose but movable, and evidently intended
to be movable. One of them had a
brass ring, by which it could without difficulty
be lifted out of its place. Once it was lifted
those on each side could be moved too. Mr.
Eames, mildly excited, uncovered a square
hole into which it was possible to step.
</p>

<p>
The legend of the existence of a passage
connecting the church with the cave came back
to his mind. There must, he thought, be some
truth in it, for he had lit on what looked like
the end of a passage leading from the church
to somewhere, perhaps into the cave. With
the aid of an ordnance survey map and some
measurements which he took, he reached the
conclusion that the end of the cave must be
directly under the church. He discovered the
chimney in the cave's roof which had excited
Beth and Jimmy when they found it. It seemed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_238' name='Page_238'>[238]</a></span>
perfectly plain that the hole inside the church
and the chimney in the cave were part of one
passage. Unfortunately the hole was filled
with stones and loose earth. In order to
establish the connection, Mr. Eames had to
do some excavating. He brought up the spade
from the vicarage and afterwards the pickaxe
which Mrs. Eames missed and supposed to
be lost or stolen. Coming on a large block of
stone, one of the main causes of the obstruction,
he found that he could not move it with
his hands. He went very early in the morning
and took young Bunce's tackle from the mouth
of the cave. After the removal of that stone
he got on rapidly and had almost completed the
clearance when Beth and Jimmy visited the cave.
</p>

<p>
"I have great hopes," he said simply, "that
your aunt will be pleased when I show her the
hole leading straight down into the cave."
</p>

<p>
"I'm sure she will," said Beth.
</p>

<p>
"And she'll never be able to say again that
I do nothing for the parish. A discovery like
that ought to be quite useful for any parish.
Don't you think so?"
</p>

<p>
"It will make Hailey Compton famous,"
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_239' name='Page_239'>[239]</a></span>
said Beth, "and Aunt Agatha will be able to
get up another pageant to show it off."
</p>

<p>
Jimmy seemed uninterested in the ultimate
value of the hole to the modern parish. He
wanted to understand what it was like and how
it was originally used.
</p>

<p>
"Are there any remains of steps?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Oh no," said Mr. Eames, "it's just a hole.
In fact I shall have to be very careful not to
fall through when I'm finishing off the digging."
</p>

<p>
"I didn't see any sign of steps at the lower
opening," said Jimmy.
</p>

<p>
"They may have used ladders," said Beth.
</p>

<p>
"My idea," said the vicar, "is that the men
didn't go up and down at all. The passage was
only used for hoisting things from the cave into
the church. It's just a straight drop like a well,
and anything could be pulled up."
</p>

<p>
"Anyhow," said Jimmy, "it's a most interesting
thing and everybody ought to be most
grateful to you for finding it."
</p>

<p>
"You really think so," said the vicar with
an anxious little smile. "I should be very
happy if I thought my wife would take that
view of it."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_240' name='Page_240'>[240]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Oh, she's sure to," said Beth.
</p>

<p>
"But don't tell her about it until it's quite
finished. It would be so much better if it comes
to her as a surprise."
</p>

<p>
"I won't open my lips," said Beth, "and
you can count on Jimmy. He's most reliable."
</p>

<p>
"And do you really think," said the vicar,
appealing to Jimmy, "that I have succeeded at
last in doing something for the parish?"
</p>

<p>
"I can only say, sir," said Jimmy, rising from
the bier, "that I wish I'd half your luck. I
came up to your church this evening hoping to
find something really useful to do, something
which would redeem my life from mere
fatuity&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, do shut up, Jimmy," said Beth. "I
never said that."
</p>

<p>
"Not in those words," said Jimmy, "not in
nearly such nice words, though you are an
author. But it's exactly what you meant.
And now I find&mdash;&mdash;" he turned to the vicar,
"that you've been beforehand with me. I
congratulate you."
</p>

<p>
The vicar seemed puzzled. He looked inquiringly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_241' name='Page_241'>[241]</a></span>
at Beth out of his colourless, watery
eyes, while Jimmy shook his limp and earthy
hand with painful heartiness.
</p>

<h2>Chapter XVI</h2>

<p>
Of the actual performance of the Hailey Compton
pageant it is surely unnecessary to give any
account here. Every newspaper in England
devoted columns to the description of the
brilliant scene. It is impossible for anyone to
have escaped reading something about it and,
knowing that it was an immense success, perhaps
the most popular show since the Diamond
Jubilee of Queen Victoria. The least observant
among us can scarcely have helped looking at
the picture of the last Prime Minister, in a silk
hat and frock coat, shaking hands with Lord
Colavon, the helmsman of the lugger, who was
attired, in spite of Sir Evelyn's antiquarian
scruples, in white flannels and a yachting cap.
Quite as widely reproduced was the photograph
of the bishop patting the head of one of the
pack horses, while the two girls responsible for
it stood beside him with chaste smiles, as if
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_242' name='Page_242'>[242]</a></span>
they expected to have their heads patted when
the bishop had done with the horse; which
indeed happened to both of them, though the
photographs of that patting were not published.
</p>

<p>
The day of the performance was singularly
fine, which was pure luck, but helped greatly
towards its success. Had it been raining or
even drizzling the great scene would almost
certainly have been a failure. The flare on the
church tower might have smoked instead of
blazing. The signal lamps on the lugger out at
sea would have been invisible on shore. But
it was not luck, it was skill, which chose the
exact moment for the arrival of the lugger.
An hour earlier, when the glow of the setting
sun was still strong, the blaze on the tower
would have been unimpressive, and the flashing
lights at sea would have escaped notice altogether.
An hour or two hours later, when the
twilight had died away, it would have been impossible
for the spectators to see what happened
when the lugger reached the cave. But Mrs.
Eames&mdash;Sir Evelyn got the credit in the newspapers
but Mrs. Eames deserved it&mdash;chose what
Beth in a description of the performance called
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_243' name='Page_243'>[243]</a></span>
the psychological moment. It was just dark
enough for the signal lights to make a good
display, and there was still light enough to
allow the operations of landing the cargo to be
observed.
</p>

<p>
It was skill and not luck which selected the
day for the performance, and here the credit
belongs almost entirely to Lord Colavon. He
discovered a day&mdash;perhaps the only day during
the whole of that summer&mdash;when there was
nothing else of great importance going on.
Ascot was over. The Wimbledon Tennis Tournament
had not yet begun. There was a pause
between the first and second Test Matches.
Yachts had not yet begun to race in popular
waters. Interest in the regatta at Henley had
died away. The fashionable world and that
greater public which amuses itself in fashionable
ways had nowhere particular to go on that
particular day; no engagements and nothing
fresh to talk about. The Hailey Compton
Pageant filled a gap.
</p>

<p>
It had been very well advertised, again a
matter of skill, though mingled with luck. It
was Beth Appleby who deserved praise for the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_244' name='Page_244'>[244]</a></span>
advertising. She did not, indeed&mdash;no single
person could&mdash;write all the preparatory notes
and articles which appeared for weeks beforehand.
She did not supply the papers with all
the photographs they published. Other journalists,
discovering and developing the popularity
of the pageant, earned their guineas. But
it was Beth who did the spade work and forced
the pageant on the attention of editors who
might otherwise not have noticed it. Her
character sketch of James Hinton&mdash;"Valet
and Artist"&mdash;attracted attention in a popular
Sunday paper. A study of Mrs. Eames as an
enthusiastic and successful reviver of the best
features of mediæval village life, with its
apt quotations from Blake's poems&mdash;"Dark,
satanic mills" and "England's green and pleasant
land"&mdash;won the sympathy and support of the
intellectual neo-Catholics, a school of writers
who still possess a great, though diminishing
influence among the members of suburban
literary societies. Her intimate account of
Sir Evelyn's home life&mdash;"Studious research
and patient pursuits of original sources"&mdash;was
read, or at all events talked of, all over
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_245' name='Page_245'>[245]</a></span>
Oxford. It was she who circulated the first published
photograph of the cave, several "camera
portraits" of old Bunce, of the mentally deficient
Whittle, and of Lord Colavon seated at the
steering wheel of the Pallas Athene. Her
success stimulated other photographers, and the
press was flooded, though by no means sated,
with snapshots of every person and place
connected with the pageant. There was even,
in one paper, a picture of Mr. Linker, standing,
with a smile on his face, in front of the door of
his shop in Morriton St. James.
</p>

<p>
The results of all this care, thought and skill,
were obvious early on the afternoon of the
great day. People had talked to each other
about Hailey Compton and wondered where it
was. Newspapers found themselves obliged
to publish road maps, often very inaccurate, to
satisfy this desire for information. Motor-cars
of every size and make converged on the stretch
of down land above the cliffs, followed each
other in a long procession along the road, and
plunged, one after another, down the twisting
lane. There were no accidents, because it was
impossible for any car to break free from
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_246' name='Page_246'>[246]</a></span>
control and rush down the hill. When any brakes
failed or any driver lost his nerve, his car
merely bumped gently into the one in front.
There was not room for it to gather dangerous
speed before the collision and to produce
disaster it would have had to push, not
one or two but at least a hundred cars in
front of it, a thing impossible for any single
car to do.
</p>

<p>
A little more than half-way down the hill
Mr. Linker had established a kind of toll-gate
through which no car was allowed to pass without
the payment of a fee. Some people resented
this interference with the freedom of the King's
highway, but their protests were futile. They
never had time to say much or express their
feelings fully, for the pressure of the cars behind
drove theirs forward while they were still arguing
about their rights. The takings at this toll-gate
were enormous.
</p>

<p>
The catering for the multitude&mdash;preliminary
afternoon tea and cold supper afterwards&mdash;was
managed by James Hinton. There was, late
in the evening, a shortage of ham, tongue and
lamb, for the numbers exceeded all expectation.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_247' name='Page_247'>[247]</a></span>
But the cold beef held out until the end and
there was no failure of salad.
</p>

<p>
For Mrs. Eames the day was one of unmixed
and rapturous delight. Every single part of
the performance went without a hitch, exactly
as she had planned it. Even the mermaid
dance&mdash;Mary Lambert and twenty village girls
along the margin of the sea&mdash;was successful, a
surprising thing and highly creditable to every
one concerned in it, for it was very difficult to
dance gracefully over large, round stones.
</p>

<p>
Sir Evelyn was well pleased with himself and
everyone else. His introductory speech, those
few words, without which no function of any
sort can get started, were taken down by eager
reporters, and cheered by all who could hear
them and many who could not. He had on
one side of him the Chief of his Party, who
shook hands with him in warm congratulation
when the performance was over, and on the
other side, the bishop, who graciously expressed
a wish that the whole thing might be done again
in the grounds of his palace, fifty miles inland,
for the benefit of the cathedral funds. Other
eminent men and women who clustered behind
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_248' name='Page_248'>[248]</a></span>
him, were fluent in their compliments, which
was easy for them, because each one had come
with a neat little speech prepared, in case, as
each one hoped, such a thing should be required.
</p>

<p>
Sir Evelyn felt that he was once more in his
proper place, almost as prominent as he had
been and hoped to be again when his Party was
in power and he was a Cabinet Minister. But
though pleased and satisfied, Sir Evelyn was
exceedingly tired when the affair was over.
His labours had begun long before he arrived
at Hailey Compton for the performance, and
continued for two whole days after the pageant
was over. He entertained for the occasion all
the more eminent patrons of the pageant, and
they made a difficult party to manage. The
bishop was as suave and smiling as a Christian
prelate ought to be, and he got on very well with
the young actress who talked with him in the
latest slang. But he did not get on equally well
with the titled doctor who happened to be an
anti-Christian by temperament, and wanted to
repeat all the witticisms he had ever heard about
the Church when he found himself, a little unexpectedly,
in distinguished company. There
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_249' name='Page_249'>[249]</a></span>
were moments of anxiety when the judge, who
was strongly prejudiced against all doctors,
insisted on saying what he thought about expert
medical witnesses, and the evidence they gave.
Beth Appleby and Mary Lambert would, perhaps,
have been no great help to Sir Evelyn even
if they had been still at the Manor House. They
had both gone to the vicarage at Hailey Compton
before the important guests arrived. Mary
had to be on the spot for rehearsals of the mermaid
dance. Beth found it desirable to be at
the centre of activity. Both knew that there
would be no room for them at the Manor House
and had enough tact and good sense to go away,
though Sir Evelyn invited them to stay on.
Jimmy was with him still, and was really helpful.
Having the sort of temperament which is unaffected
by the pomposities and vanities of
elderly and successful men, he remained infectiously
cheerful and often saved an awkward
situation by making jokes so silly that everybody,
except the actress, united to snub him
and felt quite friendly with each other when
they had succeeded. But even Jimmy added
a little to his uncle's difficulties with the party.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_250' name='Page_250'>[250]</a></span>
He took the ex-Prime Minister out for a drive
in the restored Pallas Athene and frightened
him so much that for a whole day afterwards
he was querulous and captious, the result of
a severe nervous shock.
</p>

<p>
Thus it was that when the pageant was over,
and two days later the last eminent guest had
gone, Sir Evelyn was thoroughly tired, and glad
to sit down quietly in his study. He felt a
great yearning for silence and solitude. His
surroundings promised him just what he wanted.
</p>

<p>
The sun shone in pleasantly through a large
south window and the glare, which is the great
fault of shining summer suns, was reduced by
the leaves of a virginia creeper which clustered
on the wall round the casement. Outside, a
breeze made a gentle rustling through the
branches of a glowing copper beech. The long
herbaceous border was ablaze with colour, the
brilliant blue of anchusas, the mauves and pinks
of tall foxgloves, the white of a ribbon of low
pinks, the subdued blue of violas, and the
rich reds of many sweet-williams. Sir Evelyn,
looking out, enjoyed a sense of mild relief&mdash;mild
because he was too tired to feel anything
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_251' name='Page_251'>[251]</a></span>
strongly, even the delight of sunshine and the
colours of the flowers.
</p>

<p>
Inside, the room was cool and staid. Gentle
shadows, like the caresses of middle-aged lovers,
hung over the bookshelves and the pictures on
the wall. There stood, in orderly rows, all Sir
Evelyn's favourite books; old memoirs bound
in faded calf, tall folios rich in illustrations,
rebound in purple leather and adorned with
gilt impressions of the Dent coat of arms,
portfolios of ancient charts, squat vellum-coloured
accounts of early voyages. The pictures
were those which Sir Evelyn chiefly
delighted in, sea pieces, where old-fashioned
ships lay in harbour with high-peaked bowsprits,
tall poops and hanging sails; or plunged
through crested seas while windy clouds raced
across the sky.
</p>

<p>
Sir Evelyn, stretched in a deep chair, looked
round at the books and pictures with mild
pleasure. His was the delightful ease which
follows a time of weariness. And that weariness
in his case had been the result of hard work well
done, toil brought to a successful end. Ease
without the congratulations of a satisfied
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_252' name='Page_252'>[252]</a></span>
conscience loses half its delight. Sir Evelyn's
conscience was in alliance with his surroundings
to give him the full joy of peace. His work
was done, well done, praised by all men and need
never be done again. Is any state achieved
by man on earth more delightful than that?
</p>

<p>
On the table beside his chair stood piles of
press cuttings, four large piles. They had
been taken from their green wrappers and neatly
arranged by a careful servant. Sir Evelyn had
not, while his guests remained with him, had
time to read the accounts of the pageant; but
when the judge, latest lingering of his guests,
had gone, he looked forward to the pleasure of
studying all the papers had to say about him.
Never, even when he was Cabinet Minister, had
his piles of cuttings been quite so high. But
Sir Evelyn waited, like an epicure who hesitates
before putting the delicious morsel into his
mouth, hoping to double the pleasure by adding
expectation to realisation.
</p>

<p>
While he lingered, satisfied with stillness
and silence, tenderly savouring the pleasure
to come, his chance of ever enjoying it was
snapped from him. A servant entered the room.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_253' name='Page_253'>[253]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"A gentleman has called who wishes to see
you, sir."
</p>

<p>
"I won't see anyone to-day," said Sir Evelyn.
</p>

<p>
He had seen and talked to gentlemen of
every sort and description every day and at
all hours for a week. He had been photographed,
interviewed, invited and pressed to
do fifty troublesome things. He was determined
to have no more gentlemen let loose at him.
</p>

<p>
"He's a Mr. East, sir," said the servant, "and
he says his business is most important."
</p>

<p>
"Mr. East!"
</p>

<p>
Sir Evelyn was dimly aware of having heard
the name before, but couldn't remember when
or where.
</p>

<p>
"He asked me to mention that he is connected
with the Board of Inland Revenue, sir."
</p>

<p>
"What on earth can he want with me? The
entertainment tax is paid. At least I think
we paid the entertainment tax. Mr. Linker
undertook to look after that."
</p>

<p>
"The gentleman says his business is very
urgent, sir."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose I'd better see him, though it's a
nuisance. Show him in here."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_254' name='Page_254'>[254]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Mr. East was shown in, a lean little man with
a ragged brown beard. He introduced himself
as a supervisor of Customs and Excise for the
district. He was so nervous that his hands
shook and his voice quavered.
</p>

<p>
"If there's been any misunderstanding about
the entertainment tax," said Sir Evelyn, "I
wish you'd see Mr. Linker about it. His shop
is in High Street, and at this time of day you're
sure to find him there."
</p>

<p>
Mr. East, fidgeting uncomfortably, said that
the entertainment tax had been paid and that
no question about it had been raised or was
likely to be raised by the Inland Revenue
authorities, "but&mdash;&mdash;" he stuttered, and then
hesitated.
</p>

<p>
The man's nervous fidgetiness exasperated
Sir Evelyn, who could imagine no reason why
he did not go straight to his business, whatever
it was. Yet certain excuses might have been
made for Mr. East. He was a minor officer in
a branch of the Civil Service. Nurtured in the
tradition of that great service he regarded the
Parliamentary Heads of Departments as men
who should be treated as the heathen, and some
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_255' name='Page_255'>[255]</a></span>
others, treat their gods, with reverential respect
and humble worship; although&mdash;the example
of the heathen and others may be cited again&mdash;their
commands and expressed opinions may
be and should be regarded as unimportant and
generally foolish. Sir Evelyn was, or had
been, such a god. Mr. East was an orthodox
worshipper. It is natural for pious men to
be nervous and fidgety in the presence of
gods.
</p>

<p>
And Mr. East was a man who had achieved
a certain amount of what is called education by
means of County Council scholarships and had
successfully passed the examination which admitted
him to the Civil Service. He was therefore
inclined to dislike and despise those for whom
the winning of scholarships in early life had not
been necessary and who, in spite of their expensive
education could not at any time have
passed a Civil Service examination. By temperament,
position and achievement he was
one of those Englishmen who have a thorough
contempt for our aristocracy, the class to which
Sir Evelyn unquestionably belonged. No one
is more nervous than your thoroughgoing
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_256' name='Page_256'>[256]</a></span>
democrat who is determined not to be uncomfortable
in the company of men like Sir
Evelyn.
</p>

<p>
But there was yet another reason to account
for the perspiration which was standing on Mr.
East's forehead. Imagine a worshipper forced
to accuse the god above his altar of a base fraud,
or an independent member of the middle class
who finds himself compelled to make a charge
of a dishonourable kind against a man whose
name, borne by a long list of ancestors, is
written like an endorsement across page after
page of English history.
</p>

<p>
That was the unfortunate position of Mr.
East.
</p>

<p>
He had that morning received from London
by registered post from the permanent head
of his department, instructions to visit Sir
Evelyn, to see him personally, to inform him
that His Majesty's Department of Customs
and Excise was fully aware that smuggling on
a large scale had been carried on under cover
of the Hailey Compton pageant.
</p>

<p>
Mr. East had gasped when he read that
letter. It gave details, so many gallons of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_257' name='Page_257'>[257]</a></span>
French brandy and wine, a very large quantity.
So many hundred yards of silk, the real product
of the industry of the foreign worm. The fraud
was as shameless as it was immense; and
there was no doubt whatever about the facts.
Mr. East, who knew his business and the ways
of his department, understood exactly how this
information had been received and how it came
that the department was so sure of its facts.
Notice is always sent by agents, whose business
it is to watch such things, of any considerable
shipment of contraband goods from a Continental
port. The ship which carries them is
known. The men to whom they are consigned
in England are marked.
</p>

<p>
All this Mr. East had to tell, and in the end
did tell to Sir Evelyn. He was nervous and
miserable, but he was a man possessed by
that spirit which forces the best of us to
do desperately unpleasant duties. He did
his.
</p>

<p>
Sir Evelyn's conscience was perfectly clear.
He was annoyed that such an absurd and tiresome
mistake should have been made; but he
had not the slightest doubt that it was a mistake.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_258' name='Page_258'>[258]</a></span>
He said so with the confidence of an accused
man who knows that he is innocent.
</p>

<p>
Mr. East, more nervous than ever, but still
determined to do his duty, went on:
</p>

<p>
"I'm instructed to say, sir, that the department
is unwilling to allow the law to take its
course in the case of a man&mdash;&mdash;" Here he
corrected himself and said "gentleman, in
your position. If you will make a frank statement
of the amount of contraband goods imported,
and will at once pay the full duty
applicable to such goods no further proceedings
will be taken. You will understand, sir"&mdash;Mr.
East nearly choked while saying this&mdash;"that this
leniency is only extended to you in order to avoid
what might well be a most disagreeable scandal."
</p>

<p>
Here, it is regrettable to have to relate it,
Sir Evelyn lost his temper. Being perfectly
innocent of any attempt to defraud, or intention
of making an attempt to defraud anyone, he was
very naturally indignant. He suggested in
tones of icy dignity that Mr. East should leave
the room and communicate with him further&mdash;if
further communication was necessary&mdash;through
a firm of solicitors.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_259' name='Page_259'>[259]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"I am also instructed, sir," said Mr. East,
"to say that no steps will be taken before to-morrow
morning. The department, though
unable to condone or overlook the fraud, is
willing to give you time to consider their
proposal and your position."
</p>

<p>
This was more than Sir Evelyn could stand.
He stood up and rang the bell.
</p>

<p>
"I shall direct my servant," he said, "to
show you out and not to admit you into my
house again."
</p>

<p>
Mr. East, by this time sweating at every pore
and tingling with acute discomfort, bowed and
turned towards the door.
</p>

<p>
"I ought to add," he said as he went out,
"that no attempt to remove the dutiable goods
from the cave in which we believe them to be
stored will be permitted. To-morrow at noon,
unless you have complied with the terms of the
department's proposal, our officers will enter
the cave and seize the goods."
</p>

<p>
"Your officers," said Sir Evelyn, goaded to
extreme exasperation, "may search the cave
as much as they damned well choose. They'll
find nothing there."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_260' name='Page_260'>[260]</a></span>
</p>

<h2>Chapter XVII</h2>

<p>
The departure of the last guest from the Manor
House was almost as great a relief to Lord
Colavon as to Sir Evelyn. It was he who drove
the judge and his suit case to the railway
station in Morriton St. James. Having handed
over the case to the porter and waved farewell
to the judge he felt that duty had no further
claim upon him. He swept the car round,
picked his way through the narrow streets of
the town and set out upon the road which led
to Hailey Compton. There he indulged in a
joyous burst of speed. The Pallas Athene,
restored by the new parts sent from London,
responded and showed herself to be the sort of
car he hoped and supposed when he bought
her.
</p>

<p>
The twenty miles to the top of the cliff were
covered in less than half an hour, and when
Jimmy changed gear for the descent into the
village he felt well satisfied. He had reason
to be. The weather which had pleased Sir
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_261' name='Page_261'>[261]</a></span>
Evelyn, resting in his study, delighted Jimmy
who had the sparkling sea in front of him. Beth
was at the vicarage and he was on his way to
see her. He had stored safely in the cave six
dozen pairs of silk stockings. He looked forward
to seeing the pleasure of the two girls
when he made his present to them. There were
also in the cave a number of cases of brandy,
some hundreds of bottles of champagne and
a quantity of other wine, the property of James
Hinton. There were some large bales of silk
which belonged to Mr. Linker. Jimmy was not
concerned about these. He had helped to land
them and helped to store them, without, as he
believed, attracting any attention or giving
rise to any questions or inquiries. The business
had been carried through with the greatest
ease and Jimmy's part of it was over. The
removal and final disposal of the goods was
the affair of the owners. All Jimmy had to do
was to pick up his own parcel, tuck it under his
arm and walk out of the cave with it.
</p>

<p>
The car drew up at the vicarage door and
Jimmy was greeted by the two girls with shouts
of welcome.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_262' name='Page_262'>[262]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"We're just starting off to bathe," said Mary.
</p>

<p>
"You'll come too, of course," said Beth. "If
you haven't got a bathing dress you must
borrow Uncle Timothy's. I've never known
him bathe, but he's sure to have one somewhere."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Eames, laden with towels, appeared
and greeted Jimmy.
</p>

<p>
"This is just splendid," she said. "We'll
all go and bathe together. Such a day! The
first really hot day this summer. The pool at
the mouth of the cave will be glorious. And
then you'll come back and lunch with us. Now
don't interrupt me, Beth." Beth was trying
to speak. "I know there's nothing to eat,
literally nothing. Two great hungry girls, Lord
Colavon. You can't imagine what a lot of food
they get through. But we'll send Gladys out
to borrow what she can. Her aunt may have
some bacon. Anyway we can get some bread
and cheese. I'm sure you won't mind, Lord
Colavon. Beth is trying to say that you will,
but you won't."
</p>

<p>
"I wasn't trying to say any such thing,"
said Beth. "I was trying to say that Jimmy
hasn't got a bathing dress."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_263' name='Page_263'>[263]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Would Timothy's fit you? He has one,
I know, for I bought it for him last summer.
But he's never worn it, not once. Such a pity.
But you know the sort of man your poor, dear
uncle is, Beth. He won't enjoy himself. So
tiresome of him. I'm just as fond of him as
I was the day I married him, but I do wish I
could tempt him to do something really wrong.
It would be so good for him. Not that bathing
is wrong. It isn't. Though I sometimes think
that Timothy thinks it is."
</p>

<p>
After a long search in which both girls joined,
the vicar's bathing dress was found, still wrapped
in the paper in which it had left Linker's shop in
Morriton St. James. The towel offered by Mrs.
Eames was not so new. Indeed it was far from
being clean. The vicar, apparently, had not
thought it wrong to use it.
</p>

<p>
"How tiresome," said Mrs. Eames, a few
minutes later as they crossed the beach.
"There's somebody there at the mouth of the
cave. A man. I can't think what he's doing
there. It doesn't matter really of course. Still,
it would have been nicer if we'd had the place
to ourselves."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_264' name='Page_264'>[264]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"He looks like a policeman," said Mary.
</p>

<p>
"He can't be a policeman," said Mrs. Eames.
"There aren't any in Hailey Compton. I never
saw one here in my life except on the day of the
pageant. There were a few then."
</p>

<p>
"It is a policeman right enough," said Jimmy.
</p>

<p>
They were near enough to be sure of the
uniform. Mrs. Eames was surprised and
annoyed.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps he'll go away," she said, "when
he sees we're going to bathe. I'm not particularly
modest and I don't mind any ordinary
man watching me. But a policeman is different
somehow. I'm sure you'd hate to have a
policeman standing about while you undress,
wouldn't you, Mary?"
</p>

<p>
Beth evidently disliked the presence of the
policeman quite as much as her aunt did, though
not perhaps through feelings of modesty. She
caught Jimmy's arm and looked anxiously into
his face.
</p>

<p>
"Let's wave towels and bathing dresses,"
said Mrs. Eames, "and if that doesn't make
him understand that he's not wanted you'll
have to ask him to go away, Lord Colavon."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_265' name='Page_265'>[265]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The demonstration with towels and bathing
dresses had no effect whatever on the policeman.
He stood there, stolid and unmoved, an Englishman
at the post of duty, and in all the world
there is nothing so immovable as that.
</p>

<p>
Jimmy, pushed forward by Mrs. Eames, approached
the man.
</p>

<p>
"I wonder," he said, "if you'd mind moving
away a little, a few yards along the beach in
either direction. The ladies want to bathe in
this pool and it's rather awkward if you stand
just there. No place to undress, you know."
</p>

<p>
"Very sorry, sir," said the policeman. "No
one is allowed to enter the cave. Orders, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Orders!" said Jimmy sharply. "Whose
orders?"
</p>

<p>
"Orders of the district superintendent at
Morriton St. James, sir."
</p>

<p>
Jimmy turned away and whistled softly.
Mrs. Eames addressed a vigorous protest to the
policeman. She said a great deal about the
rights of free British citizens to enter caves
if they chose. She argued about the unreasonableness
of interfering with an innocent pleasure
like bathing. She spoke, as she always did,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_266' name='Page_266'>[266]</a></span>
volubly and with energy. The policeman remained
entirely indifferent, merely repeating
the word "Orders" from time to time when
Mrs. Eames paused for breath.
</p>

<p>
"Jimmy," said Beth, in an anxious whisper,
"what's he doing here?"
</p>

<p>
"It looks to me," said Jimmy, "very much
as if somebody had tumbled to the fact that all
the cargo we landed the other night wasn't
stage property. If so, the fat's in the fire and
no mistake."
</p>

<p>
"But was there anything really smuggled?"
said Beth.
</p>

<p>
There is honour and a sense of comradeship
among thieves. Jimmy would not give away
the secrets of Hinton and Linker.
</p>

<p>
"There was that little parcel of silk stockings,"
he said, "which I promised to get for you and
Mary."
</p>

<p>
"How perfectly sweet of you," said Mary.
"I never thought you really meant to."
</p>

<p>
"I'm beginning to wish I hadn't," said
Jimmy. "That policeman&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Do you mean to say he'll take the stockings?"
said Mary. "How mean!"
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_267' name='Page_267'>[267]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"I'm very much afraid he'll do more than
that," said Jimmy.
</p>

<p>
"Jimmy, dearest," said Beth, "do you
think he'll put you in prison?"
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Eames, finding that neither protests
nor arguments affected the policeman, ended
her harangue with a threat.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps you're not aware," she said, "that
my husband is the vicar of the parish, the
Reverend Timothy Eames. I shall go straight
to him now and tell him of your outrageous
behaviour. He'll know how to deal with you."
</p>

<p>
She cannot have believed that; but she
spoke with dignity and firmness, as if her husband
was a masterful archdeacon and the
policeman a naughty choirboy. Perhaps the
policeman knew the Reverend Timothy Eames,
perhaps he was a believer in the majesty of the
law and held that the temporal power is greater
than the might of the Church. He was quite
unmoved by the threat, and when Mrs. Eames
turned her back upon him and walked stiffly
away he showed no sign of fear.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Eames, very angry indeed, stalked back
across the beach. Jimmy and the girls followed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_268' name='Page_268'>[268]</a></span>
her, Mary puzzled, Beth anxious, Jimmy thinking
deeply.
</p>

<p>
"You'd better go to the vicarage with your
aunt," he said. "I must trot off and see James
Hinton."
</p>

<p>
"But can't I help you?" said Beth. "I'm
rather frightened. I do wish you hadn't done
it, Jimmy."
</p>

<p>
Jimmy refrained from saying he was not the
only person who had done it and that things
would have been just as bad if there were no
silk stockings in the cave for her and Mary.
</p>

<p>
A fresh surprise, exceedingly alarming and
unpleasant, waited for him at the Anchor Inn.
On the bench outside were two policemen.
They were seated very much at their ease in
the pleasant sunshine, and both of them were
smoking. It was plain that they were not on
duty at the moment. Jimmy's first thought
was that Hinton had been already arrested, but
the attitude of the policemen reassured him.
It is not lolling with a pipe in his mouth that
the British constable guards an important
prisoner.
</p>

<p>
Jimmy passed into the inn and found Hinton
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_269' name='Page_269'>[269]</a></span>
in the room behind the bar packing a suit-case.
He looked white and haggard and was badly
frightened. But even with the fear of the
vengeance of the law hanging over him his
excellent manners did not fail.
</p>

<p>
"Good morning, my lord. Is there anything
I can do for your lordship? I fear the
house is rather upset, but&mdash;a glass of beer,
perhaps? I am thinking of going away for a
few days, just packing up, as you see, my lord.
But if there's anything I can do to make your
lordship comfortable before I go&mdash;&mdash; It has
always been my wish, my lord, to make any
gentleman who employs me as comfortable as
possible&mdash;or his friends, my lord."
</p>

<p>
The man, apparently, scarcely knew what he
was saying. He was frightened out of his
senses and was possessed by a desire to get away
as quickly as possible.
</p>

<p>
"You're not arrested, are you, Hinton?"
</p>

<p>
"Me, my lord! Certainly not. I've always
borne a most excellent character. No one has
ever had occasion to say anything against me.
I'm&mdash;I'm going away for a few days, my lord.
A little holiday."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_270' name='Page_270'>[270]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"There's a policeman at the mouth of the
cave, Hinton, and there are two more outside
your door at this moment. What are they
doing?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know, my lord. I prefer not to
inquire; but&mdash;&mdash;" Here Hinton's nerves
failed him completely, and he broke down.
Even his precise English failed him, and he
forgot to say "my lord" at the end of every
sentence. "Mr. Linker, he 'phoned through
this morning," he whimpered. "He said as
how that cave was to be guarded night and
day so that nobody could go in or out nor
nothing be taken in or out till to-morrow and
then the blasted Customs officers is to come
and see what's there. They can't arrest me till
then. There isn't nothing for them to go on,
till they can lay their hands on the goods.
That's why I'm off. And Mr. Linker, he's off
too. And if you take my advice you'll do a
bolt before they nab you. France I'm going to,
or maybe Spain. Linker, he's thinking of
Russia; says as how the Russian Government
won't give him up. But I don't know. I never
did trust them Bolshies myself."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_271' name='Page_271'>[271]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
It was plain that there was neither counsel
of a sensible kind nor any help to be got from
James Hinton. The man was the victim of
an ague of terror, and could not be trusted to
do the simplest thing. Jimmy left the inn,
speaking a word of cheerful greeting to the
policemen as he passed.
</p>

<p>
An hour later James Hinton placed his suit-case
in the Ford car which had once towed the
Pallas Athene into Morriton St. James. He
cranked up his engine and went clattering up
the village street. The policemen watched
him go. Then one of them took possession of
the telephone in the inn and rang up the constabulary
office in Morriton St. James. No one
had authority or power to stop Hinton, but
the police felt that it might be convenient to
know where he went, in case they wanted to
arrest him later on. The progress of the car
was reported until it was placed in a garage in
Southampton. Hinton's further movements
and his embarking on board the steamer for
St. Malo were also reported. After that, he
was left to the French police to see where he
went and what he did.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_272' name='Page_272'>[272]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Mr. Linker, making a break for freedom in
another direction, reached Amsterdam and was
there marked down by the police. Whether he
would ever have got to Russia, or what would
have happened to him there if he had, we do
not know. It turned out to be unnecessary
for him to go beyond Amsterdam. Hinton got
no further than an hotel in Paramé.
</p>

<p>
Jimmy went back to the vicarage. He found
Beth and Mary anxious and troubled. Mrs.
Eames had gone up to the church, where she
expected to find her husband. She intended,
so Beth said, to induce that unfortunate man
to go down to the cave and drive away the
policeman, by force if necessary.
</p>

<p>
"Beth," said Jimmy, "we're in a middling
tight place, all of us, especially me. I've told
you that I smuggled over a few stockings for
you and Mary."
</p>

<p>
"Surely there won't be a row over a couple
of pairs of silk stockings," said Mary. "Nobody
could be fool enough to make a fuss about
that, not a real fuss."
</p>

<p>
"As a matter of fact there are six dozen
pairs," said Jimmy. "But&mdash;&mdash;"
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_273' name='Page_273'>[273]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"How gorgeous!" said Mary. "Three dozen
each. Jimmy, we must get them somehow.
Suppose I go and make myself perfectly sweet
to that policeman. He might be beguiled into
letting me&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Do shut up, Mary," said Beth anxiously.
"This is serious. Go on, Jimmy. What were
you going to say?"
</p>

<p>
"If it was only the stockings I've smuggled,"
said Jimmy, "there wouldn't be much said
about it, but the damned lugger was half full
of brandy and wine for Hinton and bales of silk
for that sneaking ruffian Linker."
</p>

<p>
"Will they be arrested?" said Beth. "Don't
say they'll be hanged. They don't hang people
for smuggling nowadays, do they?"
</p>

<p>
"They won't be arrested or hanged if I can
help it," said Jimmy. "Not that I'd care if
they were. I'd be glad. Those two sneaking
cowards have bolted, leaving the rest of us to
take what's coming, and it'll be mighty unpleasant,
unless&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Will they put you in prison, Jimmy?"
said Mary.
</p>

<p>
"They may. I don't know, and I don't much
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_274' name='Page_274'>[274]</a></span>
care. It won't be for very long, anyhow. What
I mind is the infernal mess Uncle Evie will be
in, and your aunt, and the bishop, a thoroughly
decent old boy that bishop, and all the rest of
them. They'll never be able to hold up their
heads again. What I mean to say is, it doesn't
matter about a fellow like me. But how can
Uncle Evie go on being a leading statesman and
all that? How can the bishop go on preaching
the way bishops do? How can your aunt
go on being a vicar's wife, if once it comes out
that they've all been deliberately defrauding
the revenue on a large scale?"
</p>

<p>
"Do you mean to say that Aunt Agatha
will have to give up being married to Uncle
Timothy?" said Beth. "She never will, whatever
they say or do to her."
</p>

<p>
"She'll have to," said Jimmy. "Either
that or he'll have to resign the parish,
unless we can pull them out of the mess
they're in."
</p>

<p>
"Then let's do it," said Beth. "I'm on
for anything to save Aunt Agatha and your
old pet of an uncle whom I love. And the
bishop. I've always liked bishops, and this
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_275' name='Page_275'>[275]</a></span>
one seemed particularly nice. You'll help too,
Mary, won't you?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course I will. I may not be as keen on
bishops as you are, Beth, but there are very
few things I wouldn't do for the sake of three
dozen pairs of silk stockings."
</p>

<p>
"The first question," said Jimmy, "is, can
we persuade your uncle to chip in and stand by
us?"
</p>

<p>
"He'd do anything for Aunt Agatha," said
Beth. "He's just as fond of her as she is of him."
</p>

<p>
"I wonder would he do the sort of thing that
some people might call wrong?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course he would," said Mary. "Anybody
would. All really nice and exciting
things are wrong, but everybody does them."
</p>

<p>
Beth was doubtful.
</p>

<p>
"Uncle Timothy," she said, "isn't like you,
Mary, or like most other people. He has a
conscience, rather a queer kind of conscience,
quite different from Aunt Agatha's, though hers
is pretty silly too. The way it takes her is,
making her do things, for the parish and all
that; whereas it works the other way round
with Uncle Timothy, and won't let him do
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_276' name='Page_276'>[276]</a></span>
anything hardly. Queer things consciences are,
aren't they?"
</p>

<p>
"Glad I haven't got one," said Mary.
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Jimmy, "we'll try him. But
I tell you plainly that if he won't, we're in an
ugly place. Whether he helps or not, we're
in an ugly place; but it'll be much uglier if he
won't stand in with us. I'm not going to ask
him to do much; but I must be able to count
on his not giving us away. I think I'd better
go up to the church and tackle him."
</p>

<h2>Chapter XVIII</h2>

<p>
While he was speaking Mrs. Eames came up
the drive holding the vicar's hand. She was
trying to walk much more quickly than he
wanted to, and it looked as if she was dragging
him after her, a prisoner, but apparently not an
unwilling one, for his face expressed a kind of
puzzled delight.
</p>

<p>
"Beth," she shouted, "you naughty girl!
And you're just as bad, Lord Colavon. Fancy
your knowing all about it for days and days and
never saying a word to me, either of you."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_277' name='Page_277'>[277]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"I've just been showing her our little discovery,"
said the vicar in a tone of mild apology.
"You remember, Beth, the passage from the
church to the cave."
</p>

<p>
"Aunt Agatha," said Beth, "I want to
tell you&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You were a wicked girl not to tell me
before," said Mrs. Eames. "It's the most exciting
thing that's ever happened in Hailey
Compton. We'll get down the Royal Society
of Antiquaries&mdash;I suppose there is a Royal
Society of Antiquaries. If there isn't we'll get
down the whole British Association, all sorts
of learned men from everywhere. You remember
the fuss that there was over that skull they
dug up somewhere a few years ago. That will
be nothing to what this will be. Hailey Compton
will be famous all over the world. I always
said you ought to do something for the parish,
Timothy, and you have at last."
</p>

<p>
"I'm so glad you're pleased," said the vicar
with a wavering little smile.
</p>

<p>
"Aunt Agatha&mdash;&mdash;" said Beth again.
</p>

<p>
"Don't interrupt your uncle, Beth, when
he's just going to tell us all about his discovery."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_278' name='Page_278'>[278]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Eames," said Lord Colavon, "I
really must speak to the vicar for a minute.
It's about a serious business and dashed unpleasant."
</p>

<p>
Even Mrs. Eames was silenced for a moment
by the gravity of his tone. When he began
to tell the story of the smuggling she grew
excited and indignant.
</p>

<p>
"So that's what James Hinton had in his
mind all the time," she said, "and he was only
pretending to be interested in the pageant.
Guaranteeing fifty pounds! And all the time
I thought&mdash;&mdash; He has&mdash;&mdash;" here she stamped
her foot, "he has had the insolence to make a
fool of me, he and that nasty Linker, a man I
always hated, though I did deal at his shop.
But I never will again, or with Hinton. I'll
get any beer I want somewhere else, or I'll do
without beer altogether. Lord Colavon, do
you mind not having any beer for luncheon
to-day? Timothy, you must promise me never
to have Hinton for your churchwarden
again."
</p>

<p>
"The worst of it is," said Jimmy, "that the
Inland Revenue people have found out."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_279' name='Page_279'>[279]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"I'm glad to hear it," said Mrs. Eames.
</p>

<p>
"And now," said Jimmy, "I'm very much
afraid that there may be arrests."
</p>

<p>
"The policeman at the mouth of the cave!"
said Mrs. Eames. "So that's why he was there.
I don't care. I'm glad. Let him arrest James
Hinton as soon as he likes. I'd like to see him
in prison. After the way he made fools of us
all he deserves it."
</p>

<p>
"Hinton has run away," said Beth, "and
the policeman will arrest you."
</p>

<p>
"That's ridiculous," said Mrs. Eames. "He
can't arrest me. I haven't smuggled. They
can't touch me, can they, Lord Colavon?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't think they can arrest you," said
Jimmy, "but they may arrest me. And anyhow,
there are other things to consider besides
arrests. There's your reputation, Mrs. Eames,
and Uncle Evie's, and the bishop's, and&mdash;well,
all the people who've been down here, patrons
of the pageant and so forth. When this scandal
comes out&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Even Mrs. Eames, though conscious of
complete innocence, saw that a scandal
would be most unpleasant for everyone, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_280' name='Page_280'>[280]</a></span>
very damaging for men like Sir Evelyn and the
bishop.
</p>

<p>
"But Jimmy has a plan," said Beth. "If
only Uncle Timothy will agree to it. Jimmy,
what is your plan?"
</p>

<p>
Jimmy explained a simple but promising
scheme. The examination of the cave and the
seizure of the smuggled goods would not take
place until the next day. If, in the meanwhile,
all the brandy, wine and silk could be removed
from the cave the Customs officers would find
no smuggled goods. There would therefore
be no evidence that contraband goods had been
landed or that any smuggling had actually been
done. Whatever suspicions might be entertained
there would be no sort of proof.
</p>

<p>
"But we can't get the things out of the cave
with a policeman on guard," said Beth. "Unless&mdash;&mdash; Oh,
Jimmy, the hole from the church
into the cave! Could we?"
</p>

<p>
"We can," said Jimmy, "if the vicar will
let us."
</p>

<p>
"I won't have poor darling Timothy mixed
up in it," said Mrs. Eames. "He's never done
anything wrong in his life."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_281' name='Page_281'>[281]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"I don't think this is very wrong," said Beth.
</p>

<p>
"It's helping a fraud," said Mrs. Eames,
"and that is wrong. What is it called?
Accessory after the fact or something. Anyhow
it's wrong and Timothy mustn't do it.
They can arrest me if they like and put me in
prison, but I won't have Timothy dragged into
it."
</p>

<p>
She put her arm round his neck and stood
beside him, her free hand tightly clenched, the
fire of defiance in her eyes.
</p>

<p>
"What do you say yourself, sir?" said
Jimmy.
</p>

<p>
The vicar said nothing for a while. He may
have been trying to make up his mind what
he ought to say, or it may have been simply that
his wife's clasp on his neck was so tight as to
make speech impossible.
</p>

<p>
Jimmy, <i>advocatus diaboli</i> in the matter, put
the case for wrong-doing as strongly as he
could. The reputations of many eminent men
were threatened by a scandal from the defilement
of which none of them would ever be able
to get wholly clear. The good name of the
Church was in peril. The prospects of a great
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_282' name='Page_282'>[282]</a></span>
party in the State were in jeopardy. Every
man, institution or party has enemies. The
enemies of religion, atheists and mockers, would
fasten on the bishop and through him would
injure the Church and Christianity itself. The
enemies of the State, socialists and communists,
would swarm round Sir Evelyn and work incalculable
mischief. The scandal would give
them the opportunity they wanted. He
pleaded earnestly. Beth backed his appeal;
but Mrs. Eames's eyes still flashed righteous
indignation and her fist was still tightly
clenched.
</p>

<p>
"Agatha, dear, do let me speak," said the
vicar in a hoarse whisper.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Eames slightly relaxed her hold on his
neck.
</p>

<p>
"You've often said," the vicar began addressing
his wife, "You've often said that I would
be a better man if&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You couldn't be better, Timothy darling.
I've always said that."
</p>

<p>
"&mdash;&mdash;that I would be a better man if only
I would do something wrong."
</p>

<p>
"Timothy, dearest one, I never said that."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_283' name='Page_283'>[283]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"You did, Aunt Agatha," said Beth. "I've
heard you often."
</p>

<p>
"I rather think I have, too," said Jimmy,
"once or twice."
</p>

<p>
"I should like to be a better man," said the
vicar. "I've always wished to be that."
</p>

<p>
"And you will be," said Jimmy. "If you
help us in this you'll be&mdash;&mdash; By Jove! you'll
be the best man I've ever met."
</p>

<p>
"And it isn't very wrong," said Beth.
</p>

<p>
"It isn't wrong at all," said Mary eagerly.
"When anyone is wicked enough to make a
law against silk stockings it isn't wrong to
break it, it's right."
</p>

<p>
"The wronger it is the better man the vicar
will be afterwards," said Jimmy. "That's
what Mrs. Eames says, and she knows."
</p>

<p>
"If I ever said any such thing&mdash;&mdash;" said
Mrs. Eames.
</p>

<p>
"You have," said the vicar. "My dear
Agatha, you often have."
</p>

<p>
"I may have," said Mrs. Eames unwillingly.
"But if I did, I certainly never meant the
sort of wrong thing you could be put in prison
for."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_284' name='Page_284'>[284]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"But he won't be," said Jimmy, "or if he is,
we'll all be there with him."
</p>

<p>
"I've always known you were quite right,
Agatha, dear," said the vicar plaintively, "and
that I ought to do something wrong. My
difficulty was to find out something that I could
do. I really didn't want to restore a church or
write a book about heretics, and nothing else
seemed to offer itself. But now&mdash;&mdash; Lord
Colavon, I'm greatly obliged to you, and I
regard this as just the opportunity I wanted.
Agatha dearest, don't say anything more."
</p>

<p>
But that was asking too much of Mrs. Eames.
She did say a great deal more, though nothing
to dissuade the vicar from his determination to
pursue the crown of sainthood through the
ways of wrong-doing. Having withdrawn her
opposition to Jimmy's plan she flung herself
eagerly into a discussion of the best ways of
carrying it out. There were a great many
details to be arranged. Young Bunce's tackle,
for instance, which was still in the church, was
plainly insufficient for the work of hoisting
things out of the cave. The rope was not long
enough. As the police were blocking the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_285' name='Page_285'>[285]</a></span>
ordinary entrance to the cave someone would
have to be let down to the cave and afterwards
hoisted up. Jimmy volunteered for the work
but objected to trusting his life to young Bunce's
frayed rope. He proposed to buy a new outfit
of ropes and blocks, some materials for the
erection of a derrick in the church and perhaps
a windlass. It was regarded as undesirable to
make such purchases in Morriton St. James,
where the suspicions of the police might easily
be aroused. Here the Pallas Athene proved
its value. With such a car it would be possible to
rush off to Southampton, thence to Portsmouth,
afterwards, if necessary, to Plymouth, places in
which such gear might be purchased, a rope here
and a block there, without giving rise to inquiries.
</p>

<p>
There was the question, a much more difficult
one, of the disposal of the smuggled goods after
they had been lodged in the church.
</p>

<p>
"They can be piled up in the old pew in the
chancel," said Mrs. Eames, "and the curtains
drawn. No one ever goes there."
</p>

<p>
"But they can't always stay there," said
the vicar. "I shouldn't like the feeling that
the church was full of brandy."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_286' name='Page_286'>[286]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"I don't see how we could possibly take all
that stuff away," said Beth, "or where we
could put it if we did."
</p>

<p>
Here Mary made a suggestion, though not a
very helpful one.
</p>

<p>
"I'll carry my stockings away with me," she
said, "and I'll take yours, too, if you like,
Beth."
</p>

<p>
"Couldn't we leave it to Hinton and Linker
to take away their own things?" said Beth.
</p>

<p>
"Certainly not," said Mrs. Eames vindictively.
"It was Hinton and Linker who got
us into this trouble, and I'll never agree to their
being rewarded for it."
</p>

<p>
"Besides," said Jimmy, "they've both run
away and we can't get at them."
</p>

<p>
It was, oddly enough, the vicar who hit on
the solution of the difficulty.
</p>

<p>
"This is only Tuesday," he said. "As
long as the things are taken out of the church
before Sunday it will be all right. Suppose
we lower them all down into the cave again on
Friday or Saturday. The Customs officers will
have given up searching by that time."
</p>

<p>
"Splendid!" said Beth. "No one ever
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_287' name='Page_287'>[287]</a></span>
goes into the cave except you, Aunt Agatha.
I should think the brandy and other things might
stay there for ever without anybody knowing."
</p>

<p>
"It does seem a pity about the silk," said
Mary. "Such waste."
</p>

<p>
"And I did hope&mdash;&mdash;" said Mrs. Eames, with
a deep sigh.
</p>

<p>
Everyone understood and sympathised with
her. She was called upon to renounce her
ambition, to surrender a great hope at the
very moment of fruition. The cave had been
advertised by the pageant, would be re-advertised
by the vicar's discovery. Crowds of
people would come to see it. Antiquaries
would explore its depths. Picnic parties would
shout hilariously to its echoing walls. Just
one effort, scarcely an effort, merely the allowing
of things to take their course and all this
would be realised. Hailey Compton would be
famous. Wealth would pour in upon its inhabitants.
A great and glorious work for the
village would be accomplished. But all this,
so it seemed, must be given up. The cave must
lapse into a solitude again and the village remain
as poor and primitive as it had ever been.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_288' name='Page_288'>[288]</a></span>
It was a bitter disappointment to Mrs. Eames;
but she bore it bravely, sustained by the thought
that her beloved Timothy was at last doing
something, though something in itself undesirable.
</p>

<p>
For the rest of that morning and all the
afternoon the Pallas Athene raced at incredible
speeds, east and west on the great main roads
of the south of England. Jimmy, at the
steering-wheel, broke record after record and
rejoiced. Beth, beside him, glowed with a
satisfaction not unlike her aunt's. Like the
Reverend Timothy Eames, Jimmy, her lover,
was proving himself a worthy man, actually
doing something of real usefulness. He was
breaking laws with reckless daring all day long
in order to be able to break other laws all night.
But&mdash;Beth thrilled with the thought, he
was saving the honour of men and women,
the good name of the church, the constitution
of the State, the majesty of the Empire.
</p>

<p>
At ten o'clock that night, Jimmy, seated in
the loop of a carefully tied knot, was lowered
slowly, turning giddily round, from the squire's
pew in Hailey Compton church into the profound
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_289' name='Page_289'>[289]</a></span>
darkness of the cave below. Clinging tightly
to the rope, paying it out inch by inch were
Mrs. Eames, Mary Lambert, Beth Appleby and
the vicar. Their muscles were tense, their
faces set with anxious determination. A
distant sound of rolling stones and a sharp
twitching of the rope told them that the ordeal
was safely over. The rope was hauled up again
and Beth, with white face and clenched teeth,
took her seat in the loop. She grasped the rope
above her firmly. The descent began. She
bumped against the sides of the hole and was
bruised. She grew giddy as the rope swung
round and round. But her courage held. She
was received at last in Jimmy's arms.
</p>

<p>
Then began for the whole party a night of
desperate toil. Jimmy and Beth, sweating
and half smothered in the close air of the cave,
dragged the bales and cases to the gaping hole.
Their fingers bled where the skin was rubbed
off them. Their nails were broken. Their
muscles were strained to utter weariness. Far
above them, the vicar, Mrs. Eames and Mary
hauled at the rope. The slowly raised weights
seemed to grow heavier and heavier. They
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_290' name='Page_290'>[290]</a></span>
moved uneasily in a space which became gradually
narrowed and less sufficient as bales and
cases were piled up in the square pew. How
fortunate that the eighteenth century lord
of the manor, who designed and built the pew,
should have liked ample space for his devotions!
He planned largely, a room rather than a pew,
intending perhaps to use the place not only for
worship but for just such purposes as it was
used for that night.
</p>

<p>
All night long&mdash;such are the curious inequalities
of the human lot&mdash;a policeman stood at
the mouth of the cave. While others toiled,
he wearied of utter idleness. While others
gasped for air, the sea breeze blew round him.
While others sweated, he stamped his feet and
swung his arms to keep himself warm. In the
new society of which we dream, for which we
strive, things must be better ordered. No
longer must our souls be vexed by the contrast
between excessive toil and listless idleness.
</p>

<p>
Yet&mdash;and here again we have an instance
of the oddness of human affairs&mdash;the leisured
policeman, yawning and stretching himself,
missed something which came to the perspiring
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_291' name='Page_291'>[291]</a></span>
toilers in the cave&mdash;a thrill, a joy, a rapture
which more than compensated for bleeding
knuckles, broken nails and aching
limbs.
</p>

<p>
The last case was secured in its sling and
ascended slowly into the darkness. The work
of the night was finished. In a few minutes
Beth would be following the case, seated in the
loop, clinging to the rope. Then Jimmy would
follow her, and after that&mdash;&mdash; He hoped that
Mrs. Eames had some beer in the vicarage.
He believed she had. He thought she must have.
No woman would be so foolish as to forget to
have beer ready at the end of such a night.
Beer! Not since the day when Sir Evelyn
first drove down the hill into Hailey Compton
had any man wanted beer so much as Jimmy
wanted it then.
</p>

<p>
But Beth, it seemed, was not thinking of
beer, or even of tea, which for some women
takes the place of beer.
</p>

<p>
"Jimmy," she said softly, "do you remember
the last time we were here?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course I do. A smuggler's ghost threw
stones at us."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_292' name='Page_292'>[292]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"And I said&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Beth paused for a while. Then the darkness,
a wonderful solvent of maiden modesty, helped
her to go on again.
</p>

<p>
"I think I said&mdash;&mdash; I mean, after you said&mdash;&mdash; You
remember what you said&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I said what I've been saying for the last
two years," said Jimmy. "And what you said
was 'No.'"
</p>

<p>
"But I told you why," said Beth.
</p>

<p>
"You've always been telling me why."
</p>

<p>
"Jimmy," she burst out, "are you going to
make me propose to you? Don't you see, you
silly old dear, that that isn't a why any longer?
You've been perfectly splendid to-night. You've
thought of things and done things&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash; Oh,
Jimmy, only for you where would everybody
be to-morrow when the horrid Customs
officers come to search the cave?"
</p>

<p>
Then, though very thirsty, Jimmy forgot
about the beer. Ben Jonson, a dramatist and
a poet who knew something about human
nature and could express himself very prettily,
says that kisses are to be preferred sometimes
"even to Jove's nectar." Jimmy, tired, sore
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_293' name='Page_293'>[293]</a></span>
and grimy, in a stuffy cave, at the horrible hour
of 4 a.m., found them more to be desired than
much beer.
</p>

<h2>Chapter XIX</h2>

<p>
A good conscience is a priceless possession.
Sir Evelyn had not broken the laws of his
country by bringing into it forbidden things.
With all his admiration for the smugglers of
the eighteenth century, whose lives he studied,
it would have been impossible for him to imitate
them. Nor would he willingly have associated
with a man who smuggled anything more than
a box of cigars after a trip to the Channel
Islands. The accusation of the egregious Mr.
East left Sir Evelyn untroubled. Some incredibly
absurd mistake had been made for
which in due time an apology would be forthcoming.
It was impossible that a pageant, in
itself a highly commendable thing&mdash;a pageant
under the patronage of a bishop, of a judge, of a
man who had been Prime Minister, of Sir Evelyn
Dent&mdash;should have been in reality a smuggling
raid. Was he to suspect Mrs. Eames, a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_294' name='Page_294'>[294]</a></span>
transparently honest though too talkative lady,
of being a smuggler? And she had managed
the whole affair from the beginning. Could he
think that James Hinton, the very type of
superior upper servant, that Linker, a most
respectable shopkeeper with a taste for politics,
had deliberately planned a disgraceful fraud?
The idea was preposterous. And had not his
own nephew, Lord Colavon, to whom the petty
gains of illicit trading could be no temptation&mdash;had
he not been in command of&mdash;had he not
actually steered the lugger?
</p>

<p>
Someone in a Government office in London
had blundered badly, and the ridiculous, tremulous
Mr. East with his ultimatum and his
threats could be forgotten as quickly as possible.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, Sir Evelyn could not quite
forget Mr. East, and after a while he rose and
rang the bell.
</p>

<p>
"If Lord Colavon is anywhere about the
place," he said, "ask him to be so good as to
come and speak to me here for a few minutes."
</p>

<p>
A servant searched for Lord Colavon in the
house. A gardener sought him in the grounds.
A man who cleaned the boots and carried coal
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_295' name='Page_295'>[295]</a></span>
reported that the Pallas Athene was not in the
garage. It was surmised that Lord Colavon
had not yet returned from the railway station
to which he had conveyed the judge.
</p>

<p>
"Very well," said Sir Evelyn, "as soon as he
does return ask him to come here."
</p>

<p>
The morning passed, not unpleasantly for
Sir Evelyn, who found much to interest him in
the press-cuttings. Luncheon-time came and
he ate it alone. Lord Colavon had not yet
returned and the Pallas Athene was not yet in
the garage. The servant, surmising again,
suggested that his lordship might have gone to
Hailey Compton to visit the young ladies.
Sir Evelyn thought this very likely, and ate his
luncheon peacefully. Tea-time came, and after
that dinner, but Lord Colavon did not appear.
Sir Evelyn was slightly annoyed but not much
surprised. His nephew was a young man of
irregular habits.
</p>

<p>
The servant, bringing whisky and a siphon
into the study at half-past nine, ventured on a
further guess.
</p>

<p>
"His lordship's car may have broken down
somewhere."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_296' name='Page_296'>[296]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
This, too, seemed probable.
</p>

<p>
"Very unreliable, these high-powered cars,"
said the servant. "So I've always been led
to believe."
</p>

<p>
"Don't sit up for him," said Sir Evelyn.
"He's not likely to return to-night. I shall
go to bed as usual."
</p>

<p>
He did, at the sober hour of eleven o'clock.
He was by that time seriously annoyed and
a little uneasy&mdash;not because he feared that any
harm had come to his nephew. Whatever might
have happened to the car, Jimmy himself was
sure to be safe. Accidents do not happen to that
kind of young man, though they ought to.
Yet, Sir Evelyn reflected, it would have been
satisfactory to have heard him deny&mdash;&mdash; No.
It would be ridiculous to expect a formal denial
of Mr. East's accusation. It would have been
satisfactory to have laughed over the matter with
his nephew. To make jokes about it and hear
jokes made before going to bed. Yet, in spite of
annoyance, Sir Evelyn slept quietly that night.
</p>

<p>
Next morning at eight o'clock he was called
and his letters laid beside him. Sir Evelyn
glanced at them as he poured out his tea.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_297' name='Page_297'>[297]</a></span>
There was a thick bundle of press-cuttings,
more comments on the pageant. There were
several circulars. There were one or two
bills. There was just one envelope which
looked as if it contained a letter. It came
from a very important political personage, one
of those gentlemen whose names do not appear
prominently in the newspapers, who seldom
make speeches on full-dress occasions, but are
powerful in the councils of parties and have a
great deal to do with the administration of funds.
</p>

<p>
Sir Evelyn opened the envelope with a vague
feeling of uneasiness. The premonition was
justified at once. The letter was startling and
disquieting.
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
<i>You've no doubt heard the gossip which has
been flying round the clubs for the last two
days. I heard it yesterday and regarded it
as nothing but an unusually wild</i> canard.
<i>This morning I was forced to change my
opinion. The Inland Revenue people have,
or believe they have, information which points
to the fact that smuggling on a large scale was
successfully carried out at that pageant of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_298' name='Page_298'>[298]</a></span>
yours. By the way, I congratulate you on
the success of the affair. I couldn't manage
to get down to it, but I hear it was brilliant.
I need not say that I do not for a moment suspect
you of trying to defraud the revenue. The
suggestion is absurd. But could anything of
the sort have been going on without your
knowing it? That seems difficult to believe;
but the Inland Revenue people are very confident.
They say&mdash;I have this in strict confidence&mdash;that
they know where the smuggled goods are
hidden and can put their hands on them
whenever they like. I need scarcely remind
you that the consequences of an exposé of this
kind would be serious. No sane person would
believe that you and the Chief had combined
together to smuggle brandy into the country.
But you know the sort of mud that is slung
at Election times&mdash;we may be in for one any
day now&mdash;and how much of it sticks no matter
how carefully we wash each other's faces. If
you can give a perfectly clear and unqualified
denial to the rumour, or accusation, for it comes
to that, please telegraph to me and I'll see
that it gets proper publicity. It won't be the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_299' name='Page_299'>[299]</a></span>
first time that these permanent officials have
turned out to be too clever. But if by any
chance they can prove their case&mdash;not against
you, but against anyone connected with your
pageant&mdash;that is to say, if they can put their
hands on a case of brandy or a dozen of champagne,
then for heaven's sake pacify them in
some way. They're going to give you the
chance, I understand. Pay up. Apologise.
Do anything you can; but do not let us have
any publicity. I need scarcely say that I shall
pull every string I can to keep the matter out
of the courts, and I'll threaten any of the
papers that have been hinting at it, but I must
know definitely how things stand.</i>
</p>
</div>

<p>
Sir Evelyn, without waiting to drink his cup
of tea, rose and rang the bell.
</p>

<p>
"Is Lord Colavon in the house?"
</p>

<p>
"His lordship," said the servant, "is at present
in bed. I understand that he returned about
six o'clock this morning. The under housemaid
who was sweeping the hall at the time informed
me that his lordship&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Send him to me at once," said Sir Evelyn.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_300' name='Page_300'>[300]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Very good, sir."
</p>

<p>
But he did not do so. He returned five
minutes later to say that he found it quite
impossible to waken Lord Colavon.
</p>

<p>
"I used every endeavour, sir, but his lordship
is in a very sound sleep."
</p>

<p>
"Use more endeavours," said Sir Evelyn.
"Pour cold water over him if necessary, but
bring him here."
</p>

<p>
This time the man was successful. Jimmy,
yawning and dishevelled, walked into his uncle's
room in his pyjamas.
</p>

<p>
"Read that," said Sir Evelyn, handing him
the letter.
</p>

<p>
Jimmy, rubbing his eyes occasionally, read
it through.
</p>

<p>
"Now," said Sir Evelyn, "tell me plainly,
is there anything in it?"
</p>

<p>
"If you mean the cave, Uncle Evie, there
isn't. Not a blessed thing except stones.
They've had three policemen watching the
entrance, turn about, since yesterday, but there
isn't a thing in it except stones."
</p>

<p>
"Are you perfectly certain about that?"
</p>

<p>
"Dead sure thing," said Jimmy. "They can
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_301' name='Page_301'>[301]</a></span>
search till they're blue in the face. I'm told
that they're going to search to-day. But
they won't find anything. If I were you,
Uncle Evie&mdash;of course, it's not my business
to offer advice to you or any other big pot like
the johnny who wrote this letter. But, if I
were in your shoes or his, I'd tell the Customs
people to search and be damned. In fact I
rather thought of doing that exact thing
myself, meeting them at Hailey Compton when
they turn up and then gloating afterwards.
I dare say it would be beneath your dignity to
gloat, except in private. But if you care to
run down with me this morning and watch this
blessed search of theirs, I can promise that
you'll be in a position to rub it in afterwards."
</p>

<p>
"I won't do that," said Sir Evelyn. "But&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I hardly thought you would. That sort of
thing wouldn't suit your style."
</p>

<p>
"But I'll wire a definite denial of the whole
story to London," said Sir Evelyn, "if you give
me your assurance that I can do so."
</p>

<p>
"Pitch it as strong as you like. Pithy and
straight from the shoulder. Not too long. It
only looks as if you'd something to conceal if
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_302' name='Page_302'>[302]</a></span>
you go spreading yourself over five bob's worth
of telegram. My idea would be 'Damned lies,'
or words to that effect."
</p>

<p>
"I hope you really are perfectly certain,
Jimmy," said Sir Evelyn. "This is a serious
business. If it turns out afterwards that you're
mistaken&mdash;if they find so much as one case of
brandy&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"They won't," said Jimmy. "I'll make
over the Pallas Athene to an idiot asylum for
the use of the inmates if they find anything
worse than a half smoked cigarette in that cave."
</p>

<p>
"You'd know&mdash;you'd be certain to know if&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I steered the old lugger myself," said
Jimmy, "and I know all there is to know about
what happened."
</p>

<h2>Chapter XX</h2>

<p>
From a very early hour in the morning a sense
of impending disaster hung over the village of
Hailey Compton. The older Bunce stood at
his cottage door with a sulky scowl on his face.
The members of the lugger's crew, morose and
anxious men, sought comfort at the Anchor
Inn. They found the two policemen who were
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_303' name='Page_303'>[303]</a></span>
not on duty at the cave, and went away again
uncomforted. The younger Bunce, Tommy
Whittle, and others who had taken part in
landing the cargo, wandered about disconsolate
and miserable. No one knew what was going
to happen. James Hinton, from whom it was
natural to seek advice, had disappeared and no
one knew where he had gone. There was some
talk, low growling talk, about sending a deputation
to the vicarage to ask Mrs. Eames for
advice, or information, or anything else she
might be inclined to give. No one believed
that Mrs. Eames's advice would be any use, or
her information the least reliable; but it would
have been a comfort even to hear her talk.
</p>

<p>
At ten o'clock Gladys hurried down from
the vicarage to visit her aunt. She reported
excitedly that Mrs. Eames was still in bed and
fast asleep, that the two young ladies were in bed
so sound asleep that no noise wakened them. The
village felt that its last prop and stay had been
removed and settled down into gloomy silence.
</p>

<p>
Shortly before twelve o'clock the Pallas
Athene, hooting constantly, came down the hill,
and the sight of Jimmy's face, smiling and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_304' name='Page_304'>[304]</a></span>
confident, brought a momentary cheerfulness
to the village. But behind the Pallas Athene,
close behind it, came another car, and in it,
very soon discernible by the anxious eyes of the
watchers, were men in uniform, that neat,
half naval uniform of customs officers. The
gloom of undefined dread settled down on
everyone again. Old Bunce growled sulky
curses. Younger men muttered threats, which
they knew they dare not fulfil. Only Jimmy
offered the officers any kind of welcome, but his
manner made amends for the sullen hostility
of everyone else. He was gay and jocular.
He handed round his cigar case. He suggested
draughts of beer to be drawn at his expense. He
offered to act as guide to the cave. He accompanied
the party along the street, over the green
and across the loose white stones of the beach.
</p>

<p>
He would have gone with them into the cave
but was stopped. The senior officer fully
appreciated Jimmy's courtesy and friendliness.
No Englishman is indifferent to the friendliness
of an earl, and Jimmy had introduced himself.
But no Englishman, when on duty, will allow
even an earl the smallest privilege. Duty,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_305' name='Page_305'>[305]</a></span>
especially duty done in uniform, is a very
sacred thing. Jimmy was obliged to wait
outside at the mouth of the cave.
</p>

<p>
He waited there for half an hour and smoked
four cigarettes. He waited there another half-hour,
smoking a pipe instead of cigarettes. After
an hour and a half he sent the mentally deficient
Whittle, the only villager who ventured near the
cave, back to the Anchor Inn for beer. While he
was drinking the beer the officers appeared again.
</p>

<p>
"Interesting place that cave," said Jimmy
cheerfully. "Did you find anything inside?"
</p>

<p>
"You'll excuse my reminding you, my lord,"
said the senior officer, "that what we found and
what we didn't find is no affair of yours."
</p>

<p>
"Of course not," said Jimmy. "Have a
cigarette and some beer. You must want beer."
</p>

<p>
The senior officer did want beer. So did the
others, all four of them. Jimmy's manner was
engaging, and Jimmy, after all, was a real earl.
</p>

<p>
"Duty is duty, my lord," said the officer
apologetically.
</p>

<p>
"And duty when done," said Jimmy,
"deserves beer."
</p>

<p>
That was true, and duty when done permits of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_306' name='Page_306'>[306]</a></span>
the relaxation of official dignity. The beer in
Jimmy's jug was finished, and Whittle, grinning
foolishly, fetched some more. That was drunk.
Jimmy's cigarettes were finished. The senior
officer thawed into a confidence.
</p>

<p>
"I didn't never expect to find anything in
the cave, my lord, not me. It stands to reason
that gentlemen like yourself and Sir Evelyn
Dent wouldn't be trying those sort of tricks.
But duty is duty."
</p>

<p>
"It is," said Jimmy, "always was, and I
hope always will be."
</p>

<p>
"And when I got my orders, my lord, I
obeyed them. But, in a manner of speaking,
I knew pretty well we were after a mare's nest.
The fellow that sent the information from
France&mdash;well, I never did trust foreigners
much, and of course it's from foreigners that
sort of information mostly comes."
</p>

<h2>Chapter XXI</h2>

<p>
James Hinton waited in Paramé for three
weeks anxiously expecting news from Hailey
Compton. When he got none he supposed,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_307' name='Page_307'>[307]</a></span>
quite rightly, that nothing sensational had
happened and that he was in no danger of
arrest and imprisonment. He returned to the
Anchor Inn and now carries on his business there
as courteously and efficiently as before.
</p>

<p>
But James Hinton is a changed man. He
has suffered disillusion. He speaks, with mysterious
nods, and often in whispers, of a great
financial loss which once fell on him. He goes
into no details, but hints that he, an innocent
and confiding man, was swindled by people
whom he thought he could trust. He very
nearly, but not quite, gave me his confidence
when I was in Hailey Compton a fortnight ago
and had a chat with him over a glass of beer.
</p>

<p>
"You wouldn't think, sir," he said, "that
a lady like Mrs. Eames, a vicar's wife, would
have stooped to such meanness. Though of
course, Mrs. Eames does not belong to that
class in which I have been accustomed to live,
as a servant, you understand, sir. But I did
think that his lordship, the present earl, would
have been above it. The late earl would never
have done such a thing. But there&mdash;&mdash; It's
better not to talk about it. I can put up
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_308' name='Page_308'>[308]</a></span>
with the loss. It isn't that I mind most, but
I've been a believer in our aristocracy all my
life and it's a sad thing&mdash;a knock out, sir, if
you'll allow me to express myself in such a
way&mdash;a blow to my faith, sir, to find that&mdash;&mdash;"
He sighed heavily. "But I'd rather say no
more about it, sir, if you'll excuse me."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Linker, who also returned to his business
after a time, spoke much more plainly, and I
regret to say more bitterly, when I called on him
under pretext of buying some socks.
</p>

<p>
"I don't set up to be a gentleman myself,"
he said, "but I say that if a man is a gentleman
he ought to behave as such. And that's what
some gentlemen I know didn't do. I don't
care to go into details. It wouldn't suit
a man in my position to talk too much about
the matter. But when a gentleman like Lord
Colavon takes advantage of my temporary
absence from home to convert to his own use
property with regard to which he occupied a
fiduciary position&mdash;&mdash; As for the lady associated
with him&mdash;I refer to Mrs. Eames&mdash;well, I
always was a Nonconformist, and if that is
the sort of conduct we are to expect from the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_309' name='Page_309'>[309]</a></span>
wives of the clergy of the Church of England,
I shall remain a Nonconformist. I don't
want to be accused of setting up too high a
standard of conduct, but I do think that common
honesty might have been expected of a lady in
Mrs. Eames's position."
</p>

<p>
It was scarcely possible to miss the point of
these reproaches. James Hinton and Linker
believed that Mrs. Eames and Lord Colavon,
probably Beth and Mary, possibly the vicar
(I am not sure that Sir Evelyn escaped suspicion)
had combined together to secure for
their own use the whole cargo smuggled into
Hailey Compton. Mrs. Eames and the girls
were supposed to be wearing silk which belonged
to Mr. Linker. Jimmy and the vicar&mdash;perhaps
Sir Evelyn&mdash;were drinking Hinton's brandy and
champagne. And the law&mdash;this was the hardest
thing about the case&mdash;offered no redress to the
injured men.
</p>

<p>
Old Bunce and his friends, indeed the whole
village, believe just what Hinton and Linker
do. There is naturally a little soreness, for the
village had looked forward to a share of the
spoil. But there is no deep resentment. Mrs.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_310' name='Page_310'>[310]</a></span>
Eames has even risen in everybody's opinion.
She is more respected than she used to be and
Lord Colavon is regarded as an exceedingly
clever man.
</p>

<p>
"To look at him," said old Bunce, "you
wouldn't think there was much in him. And
as for Mrs. Eames, anybody would think she
was silly&mdash;what with her plays and her nonsense,
just as silly as they make them. I was wrong
about that, and I'm not one to be ashamed of
owning up when I am wrong. That young
fellow with the motor-car, Lord Colavon or whatever
his name is, is as smart as paint, and Mrs.
Eames isn't a fool, not by any manner of means."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Eames, who knows exactly what is said
and thought about her, feels her position acutely,
and is trying to induce her husband to seek an
exchange to some other parish. She cannot
defend herself by telling the truth. To do that
would be to invite raids on the cave with all sorts
of evil results. She has, for many years, been
doing all in her power for the village. She has
devoted her unusual powers of mind and body
to the service of the people of Hailey Compton,
and now&mdash;&mdash;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_311' name='Page_311'>[311]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"It's very hard to bear," she said to me.
"Not that I mind for myself. I don't, not a bit.
But it's cruel to have poor darling Timothy
misunderstood. Especially just when he
really has done something for the village at
last."
</p>

<p>
Jimmy, with whom I had a chance of talking
the matter over yesterday, takes a different
line.
</p>

<p>
"They think that of me, do they? By
Jove!" he said. "Well, I dare say it's just as
well they do. Unless they were satisfied that
I had the stuff safely tucked away somewhere
they'd go on searching for it till they found it.
But, look here, you know, if I'm to be regarded
as a thief I may as well do something to deserve
it. I don't want to upset your aunt, Beth"&mdash;the
Countess, looking very charming, was
present during our talk&mdash;"and I wouldn't worry
your uncle for the world, but as soon as they're
safely out of Hailey Compton I'll go and get
hold of that brandy. The silk will be ruined,
of course, but the brandy will be all right, and I
expect I could manage to hoist it up into the
church again."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_312' name='Page_312'>[312]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Jimmy," said the Countess anxiously, "you
wouldn't steal that brandy, would you?"
</p>

<p>
"Not for my own use," said Jimmy. "My
idea would be to send it anonymously to the
bishop for distribution among the country
clergy. Those poor fellows must want cheering
up and they get little enough of it. Just think
of what your uncle Timothy's life would have
been if he hadn't happened to marry your aunt.
And there can't be many vicars' wives like her.
That's why I think a few bottles of brandy and
a dozen or so of fizz would be good for them.
Their lives want brightening. Besides, the
bishop would enjoy distributing it. He's a
most benevolent old boy, and we owe him
something. Uncle Evie told me he was in a
dreadful state when he heard about the
smuggling."

THE DANCING FLOOR
</p>

<p class="hanging">
By JOHN BUCHAN, author of "John Macnab," "Greenmantle," etc.
<br />
Sir Edward Leithen, who played a leading rôle in "John
Macnab," gained the confidence of a young Englishman, haunted
all his life by a dream, and of a girl, the heiress to a Greek
island, whose quixotic sense of honour made her face alone
a great peril. The inseverable connection between the destinies
of the two, with the high test to which the courage of each was
put, makes a great love story, a stirring, original adventure, and
a fine study of modern youth.

HALF A SOVEREIGN
</p>

<p class="hanging">
By IAN HAY, author of "A Knight on Wheels," "Paid with
Thanks," etc.
<br />
Colonel Leslie Miles, naturally bashful and none too surely recovered
from shell-shock, accepts the hospitality of Sir James
Rumborough, his lawyer, and finds himself, much against his
will, included in a yachting party of dull, cranky, and otherwise
uncompanionable people, for a cruise in the Mediterranean.
During the cruise, in which the sites of ancient cities are visited,
he finds himself reconstructing the old barbaric scenes as if he
were himself a living part of them. It is all very embarrassing
for Leslie, but it is when he gets in touch with Dido Queen of
Carthage, who for the occasion assumes the body of the youthful
widow, Mrs. Hatton, with whom he is in love, that his real
troubles begin.

A story of the New Poor and the New Rich. Lady Jane Rutherford
and her daughter, who sold their beautiful home in the
Borders, and Mr. and Mrs. Jackson of Glasgow, who bought it,
and struggled to live up to it, are some of the living characters

Stories by "SAPPER," author of "Bull-Dog Drummond," "The

<br />
"Sapper" on top of his form. Here is another glorious volume
of stories by the author of "Bull-Dog Drummond." Its note
is swift drama, culminating into seeming irresistible crisis.
More marked than ever is "Sapper's" peculiar attribute,
whereby trivialities assume such potency in his hands that a
tin of seccotine that didn't "stick" proves a far more dynamic
weapon than all the knives and blunderbusses that ever
draped the most bloody-minded buccaneer. A camera, boiling
springs of Solfatara, an avenging Mamba, "a matter of
voice," all play their volcanic rôles; and though there is never
a word too many, there is always a story too little in a
"Sapper" collection.

LITTLE MRS. MANINGTON
</p>

<p class="hanging">
By CECIL ROBERTS, author of "Scissors," "Sails of Sunset," etc.
<br />
Disaster was prophesied for the marriage of Richard Manington,
a young English politician, with an American heiress. But
Manington knew deep in his heart that he had not married for
money, as Helen knew she had not married for position. Yet
both these adjuncts of their love-match are there. The situation
is subjected to Mr. Roberts' searching powers of analysis; the
scenes have all his wizardry of description; while the dominating
note is the sympathetic treatment of the actions and motives
of enchanting Mrs. Manington.

THE PIGEON HOUSE
</p>

<p class="hanging">
By VALENTINE WILLIAMS author of "The Man with the
Club-foot," "The Red Mass," "Mr. Ramosi," etc.
<br />
Rex Garrett, rising young painter and adventurous soul, who
once served in the Foreign Legion, vanishes on the night of his
wedding to Sally Candlin, a beautiful American girl, companion
to Marcia Greer, a rich widow. Mrs. Greer took Sally from a
New York dressmaker's, but lets Rex think that his bride is an
heiress. Sally lacks the courage to speak the truth until their
wedding night, and immediately after her confession Rex disappears.
Mystery is piled on mystery: thrill treads on the
heels of thrill. As in all Valentine Williams's novels real people
carry the tale along.

PRODIGALS OF MONTE CARLO
</p>

<p class="hanging">
By E. PHILLIPS OPPENHEIM, author of "The Golden Beast,"
"Stolen Idols," etc.
<br />
Mr. Oppenheim is still "the Prince of Storytellers" and "Prodigals
of Monte Carlo" is a princely story with a real Oppenheim
plot and a real Oppenheim thrill. After a nasty toss in the
hunting field Sir Hargrave Wendever consulted a heart specialist
who implied that the Baronet might have only six or eight
months more to live. Asking three of his friends hypothetically
what each would do under the circumstances, he was told that
one would try to execute a spectacular financial coup, another
would spend the time in continuous pleasure at Monte Carlo,
and a third would endeavour to make happy some people who
could not be reached by ordinary charity. Sir Hargrave vowed
to do all three.

THE SQUARE EMERALD
</p>

<p class="hanging">
By EDGAR WALLACE, author of "The Crimson Circle," etc.
<br />
The three sisters Druze, around whom Mr. Wallace's amazing
new book revolves, could not be described as living a quiet,
normal life. They formed themselves into a gang for the fulfilment
of multifarious activities not unconnected with forging,
blackmail, impersonations, and anything that led to money and
excitement. How the identity of these three enterprising women
is established and their questionable proceedings laid bare by
a slip of a girl detective forms an absorbing mystery story,
bristling with the unexpected from start to finish.

SEA WHISPERS
</p>

<p class="hanging">
By W. W. JACOBS, author of "Captains All," "Ship's Company,"
etc., with illustrations by BERT THOMAS.
<br />
A new volume of the inimitable stories which have made Mr.
Jacobs famous all over the world. It is some years now since
Mr. Jacobs has added to the world's humour and gaiety with
such a volume, and we feel sure the night watchman and
his friends&mdash;longshore and others&mdash;will make a triumphal
return. It is impossible to imitate Mr. Jacobs&mdash;he has no
imitators. His fun and his laughter are unique. The delicious
illustrations of Mr. Bert Thomas do justice even to "Jacobs"
characters.

THE UNDERSTANDING HEART
</p>

<p class="hanging">
By PETER B. KYNE, author of "Cappy Ricks," "The Pride of
Palomar," etc.
<br />
A tale of the early mining days in the West. "The Understanding
Heart" tells of a man who braved persecution, and
it records a wonderful love story and a deathless friendship.

RACHEL
</p>

<p class="hanging">
By BEATRICE HARRADEN, author of "Spring Shall Plant," etc.
<br />
The "roving spirit" possessed Rachel, and she abandoned husband
and family. She left consternation and fear of a scandal
behind her among an array of relations, and Mrs. Harraden has
some good-tempered fun at their expense. Rachel's husband
narrowly escaped "designing" housekeepers, his Victorian
sister was with difficulty prevented from practising her good
works on the home. Meanwhile Rachel went her way, and her
motives and justification receive keen-sighted and sympathetic
treatment.

YESTERDAY'S HARVEST
</p>

<p class="hanging">
By MARGARET PEDLER, author of "The Vision of Desire," etc.
<br />
The consequences of an unpremeditated theft and a chivalrous
gesture belonging to the past cropped up again in the present.
A new name, it appeared, did not give a new lease of life.
Yesterday's harvest stood unreaped between Blair Maitland and
Elizabeth when Elizabeth's father knew his story and refused
him her hand in marriage. A tale of such romance, such
dramatic intensity, and withal such dignity that it will be
second to none among Mrs. Pedler's vibrant, enthralling books.

<p class="b12">
THE VOICE OF DASHIN
</p>

<p class="hanging">
By "GANPAT," author of "Harilek," etc.
<br />
A fresh, fascinating book of adventure and action, picturesquely
and vividly set in the Hinterlands of the Karakorum. In plot and
in scene this travelled author departs from the beaten track. His
City of Fairy Towers, fantastic though gruesome, the delightfully
colloquial relations of the two young British officers who find
their way thither, an unusual love interest (and all of it set off
with a capital sense of fun), these are some of the elements in an
up-to-date, adventurous romance of an unusual character.

WHAT IS TO BE
</p>

<p class="hanging">
By J. C. SNAITH, author of "Thus Far," etc.
<br />
A romance of chivalrous adventure, moving surely towards its
fore-ordained conclusion. John Rede Chandos married Ysa,
an exiled young queen. Subsequent developments found him
a Prince Consort in a European State, feeling slightly ridiculous
and consistently, though gallantly, out of his depth. He tells his
own story, in a self-deprecating, humorous manner, from the
moment when he left his lawyer's office until the last phase,
on a mountain-top, of "a battle he was born to lose."

THE SMUGGLER'S CAVE
</p>

<p class="hanging">
By GEORGE A. BIRMINGHAM, author of "The Search Party,"
"Spanish Gold," etc.
<br />
This is the story of the Hailey Compton Village Pageant. The
people who organised it, the vicar's wife and the local innkeeper,
were unknown to fame. It had, at first, little or no backing in
the press or aristocratic patronage. It was started in a casual,
a most accidental way. Yet the Hailey Compton Pageant
excited England from end to end, set every club in London
gossiping, inspired a spate of articles in the daily papers, gravely
affected the reputation of one of our oldest and most honoured
families, and went near wrecking the prospects of one of our
historic political parties.

THE BLACK HUNTER

<p class="hanging">
JAMES OLIVER CURWOOD
<br />
First Reviews: "James Oliver Curwood, one of the best of the
romantic translators of the life of the Canadian wilderness, has
given us a fine historical novel.... His tale is a great love
story, strongly dramatic in its episodes, and the fight at the end
of the book is Homeric."&mdash;<i>Liverpool Daily Courier.</i> "This
stirring novel.... This story of the tragic love of David Rock
and Anne St. Denis and the treachery of the Intendent Bigot
makes a memorable period live again."&mdash;<i>Daily Mail.</i> "An
historical novel of much distinction. It takes us back to the
days when old Quebec was in the hands of the French, and when
the great struggle between French and English was about to
begin.... Mr. Curwood has given us an informative, thrilling
and finely written book."&mdash;<i>Edinburgh Evening News.</i>

DAVID WILDING
</p>

<p class="hanging">
By RICHMAL CROMPTON, author of "The House," "The
Wildings," etc.
<br />
Another friendly and humorous inquiry into the family life of
the Wildings, handled with a touch so deft that the Wildings
will be recognised in many a home. David's problem had
become acute, with a wife who flaunted the family tradition,
and a baby at whose christening and subsequent receptions
all sorts of incompatible Wildings had to meet. There are
rebellions and declarations of independence. But David's
mother never lost her hold on the situation.

THE AMAZING CHANCE
</p>

<p class="hanging">
By PATRICIA WENTWORTH, author of "The Black Cabinet,"
"The Dower House Mystery," etc.
<br />
Anton Blum, a deaf and dumb German peasant, came to after
an accident, and spoke&mdash;in English. He gave conclusive evidence
that he was a Laydon, though changed beyond recognition.
But which of the supposedly dead brothers he proved to be;
whether he knew himself; and whether Evelyn, who had married
Jim Laydon, could tell, makes a most romantic, enthralling
problem, at whose solution the reader is kept guessing all the
time.

THE PLANTER OF THE TREE

<br />
Philip Sanderson, a "waster" who spends his days in third-rate
London clubs and cabarets, is in love with a dancer, Sally
Lingfield, who cares nothing for him, but loves another man who
is only amusing himself at her expense. One night, when the
worse for drink, Philip knocks her down with his car, hopelessly
crippling her so that she will never be able to dance again. The
shock sobers him and brings all his better nature to the front.

THREE PEOPLE
</p>

<p class="hanging">
By MABEL BARNES-GRUNDY, author of "Sleeping Dogs," etc.
<br />
For this most fascinating story Mabel Barnes-Grundy has
created "three people" who will remain clear and distinct in
the minds and memories of her readers. All the beauty of the
love and devotion which can bind together a brother and sister
shines forth from the pages of this book. Then two people
become three people. There steps into the lives of this brother
and sister, a man, a German by birth, but with the blood of his
English grandmother in his veins. Ronnie has a hatred of
Germans amounting almost to an obsession. He has sworn an
oath that never&mdash;knowingly&mdash;will he speak to a German again.
The story works up to a dramatic climax; the atmosphere is
delightful. There is wit and sparkle in the conversation.

THE STRANGE FAMILY
</p>

<p class="hanging">
By E. H. LACON WATSON.
<br />
Here is a chronicle of rare charm. It has about it the unsensational
suggestion of authenticity. In quiet fashion it relates
the early years of the children of a country rector. It gives an
amusing picture of types and incidents in a village community.
It passes with Rudolf Strange to Cambridge and becomes an
illuminating record of the University in the 'eighties. A
penetrating observation of character and period.

<br />
Trapped in a thieves' den, shut in with the corpse of a former
victim, with death imminent, Hugh Carr, in his extremity, promises
Providence that if he escapes he will make his life a
worthier thing. In "The Third Messenger" Patrick Wynnton
relates the result of that promise. For Providence gives Carr
his chance, and gives her chance also to Kitty Magen, the
luxury-sickened daughter of a millionaire. The final triumphant
pageant of courage and love unconquered&mdash;all go to make this
swift, keen story a more than worthy successor to "The Black
Turret."

<p class="b12">
OUT OF THESE THINGS
</p>

<p class="hanging">
By JAMES A. MORLEY.
<br />
The title of this novel, "Out of These Things," is actually an
adaptation of a quotation from Hugh Walpole's works&mdash;"Of
these things ... cometh the making of man,"&mdash;and it really
fits the story, a story which has to do with the affairs of youth
and age&mdash;a twelve-year-old and a man in love, scientific research
and a secret passage, etc. There is a great deal of truth
to human nature, and of sincerity to the influences of scenery
in this book. The very inconclusiveness of its ending gives it
a plausibility, and artistry which a more conventional finale
would not exhibit. It has literary style and is a story of unusual
character, of fine quality. "Out of These Things" is a first
novel, very strongly endorsed by an eminent literary authority,
and its author should have a great future.

<p class="b12">
THE PENDULUM
</p>

<p class="hanging">
By MRS. BURNETT-SMITH.
<br />
This story is an intimate and considered study of the growth,
development and extraordinary phases of experience through
which so many individuals and families had to pass during the
most testing years of British history. It is told in the form
of a woman's diary, and presents a vivid picture, both of family
life and that deeper, more intimate life of the heart which is the
determining factor in the majority of lives.

BEVIL GRANVILLE'S HANDICAP
</p>

<p class="hanging">
By JOSEPH HOCKING, author of "The Wagon and the Star," etc.
<br />
Bevil Granville, a young fellow of good name and a fine, generous
nature, is accused of forgery and embezzlement. At the end of
seven years of penal servitude he had become hard, sullen, cruel,
vindictive. His one thought on leaving prison was to find out
the person who had really committed the deed for which he was
punished and to wreak his revenge. The narrative describes in
a series of quick moving events his endeavours to discover the
guilty person, the forces which were brought to bear on his life,
his love and his hatred, the battle between good and evil and
the final result of his schemes. There are fine descriptions of
Cornish scenes and Cornish life and character, with all their
simplicity and charm.

<br />
Miss Berta Ruck states the case for a girl of to-day who is
restricted by a Victorian guardian's opinion that a good home
should be enough. Young men and outside friends were <i>taboo</i>.
How Dorothea took the law into her own hands, how she was
extricated from a series of difficulties, makes a delightful story
that is modern in the best sense of the word.

<br />
Somewhere along the River, down past the Pool, the Death
Maker has a laboratory&mdash;a germ-farm crawling alive with all
the most hideous disease cultures you can think of. The maker
of death has cultivated enough sudden death in this germ-farm
to wipe out London in a night, and all Britain in a week. As
we follow the intrepid Maine through the inner heart of Chinatown,
there comes a feeling that sandbags descending from
upper windows upon the passer-by are by no means beyond the
range of possibility. It is all very well done&mdash;very convincing&mdash;and
the reader will give thanks for Scotland Yard and men like
Kellard Maine.

desert sand&mdash;found one another after much adventure and
tribulation. They came within an ace of disaster and death;
Lasalle, outcast from his fellow men for a supposed murder,
Camilla, bereft of protection, wandering in the desert. A powerful

<br />
The discovery of a murdered man; the criminal unknown; the
complete absence of clues; everything, in fact, which brings
Thorndyke into his own, opens this absorbing mystery. He
accumulates unnoticed evidence in his best manner, and leads
his investigations up to a startling <i>dénouement</i>, which comes as

In that extraordinary and mysterious manner of his,

COUSIN JANE
</p>

<p class="hanging">
By HARRY LEON WILSON, author of "Ruggles of Red Gap," etc.
<br />
Harry Leon Wilson's humour and charm find new and productive
investment in "Cousin Jane." She was a young woman
ill-suited to settle down among relatives who lived on the
departed glory of a Californian fortune made in the 'sixties.
Jane had inherited something of the pioneer spirit which found
that fortune, and she salved something of the wrecked estate
and gained for herself a place in the new age which had come
while she worked.

<p class="b12">
THE LAW OF THE TALON
</p>

<p class="hanging">
By LOUIS TRACY, author of "The Gleave Mystery," etc.
<br />
A wonderfully absorbing story, which opens in the Hudson Bay
district and is played out in the Scottish Highlands, with all
their weird colour and eerie charm. To secure his cousin's
fiancée Eileen, and the succession to Inverlochtie, which should
go to Lord Oban's son, John Panton, the specious Alastair had
bribed Sergeant Ferdinand Conington to drug his superior
officer just before an engagement. Court-martialled as a
drunkard and a coward, Panton is cast off by his father, and for
seven years he disappears. But news percolates at last even
to Hudson Bay, and, accompanied by his only friend, the
Canadian husky, "Spot," Panton dashes homewards in the hope
of saving the woman he loves from a disastrous marriage.

<br />
John Francis Algernon de Courci Delourede, one of the Worcestershire
Delouredes, comes up against something new&mdash;a girl,
little more than a school-girl, to whom his wealth and influence
make no appeal! Elsie Farrar goes straight to the heart not only
of John, but also of every reader who starts out to follow her on
the "passionless quest." Enriquez is a sheer delight; and the
famous trio, Mackenzie, Martin Kent, and Wally Evans, are
men who forge ahead and get things done in that quiet and
undemonstrative fashion which we like to regard as wholly
British.
